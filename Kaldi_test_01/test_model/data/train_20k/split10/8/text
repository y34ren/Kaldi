cv-valid-train-sample-000700 THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
cv-valid-train-sample-000701 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000702 BECAUSE HE WAS TERRIFIED THE BOY DIDN'T ANSWER
cv-valid-train-sample-000703 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000704 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000705 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000706 IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
cv-valid-train-sample-000707 WHAT GOOD IS MONEY TO YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000708 THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
cv-valid-train-sample-000709 SORT OF A JACK LONDON STYLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000710 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000711 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000712 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000713 BUT HE GRANTED THE TRAVELERS THREE DAYS
cv-valid-train-sample-000714 WELL THEN HELP ME DO THAT THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000715 I AM HERE THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000716 THE ARROW WAS POINTING TO THE EXIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000717 I'M GOING TO GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE DESERT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000718 DO YOU SEE THIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000719 THEY WERE TRIBESMEN DRESSED IN BLUE WITH BLACK RINGS SURROUNDING THEIR TURBANS
cv-valid-train-sample-000720 THE LIBRARY IS OPEN TO EVERYONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000721 THAT'S COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES
cv-valid-train-sample-000722 IT WAS A TENT LIKE MANY AT THE OASIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000723 HE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE PRACTICAL MATTERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000724 SHE WROTE THE STUFF
cv-valid-train-sample-000725 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000726 THE HOOKAHS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUARDS STOOD AT ATTENTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000727 ANOTHER WHO WAS SEARCHING THE BOY'S BAGS FOUND THE PIECE OF GOLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000728 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000729 I NEVER SAW AMANDA ACT LIKE THAT BEFORE
cv-valid-train-sample-000730 THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO COOL
cv-valid-train-sample-000731 OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000732 FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000733 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000734 BECAUSE NOW HE KNEW WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS
cv-valid-train-sample-000735 DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET HIDING PLACE HERE IN THE HOUSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000736 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000737 I'M GOING TO NEED IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000738 I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000739 I BET YOU FORGOT THE WINE
cv-valid-train-sample-000740 NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
cv-valid-train-sample-000741 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train-sample-000742 THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000743 AS HE WAS LEAVING HE SAW IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM HIS OLD SHEPHERD'S POUCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000744 IS THERE A MRS JOSHUA
cv-valid-train-sample-000745 I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000746 YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
cv-valid-train-sample-000747 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
cv-valid-train-sample-000748 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
cv-valid-train-sample-000749 THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000750 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000751 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
cv-valid-train-sample-000752 THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED
cv-valid-train-sample-000753 WHAT TRICKS WOULD I PULL
cv-valid-train-sample-000754 THIS SOLUTION ALSO WORKS WELL IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL A LINUX DISTRO ON WINDOWS VIA VIRTUALIZATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000755 BECAUSE FOR HIM YOU ARE A GREEN FIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME
cv-valid-train-sample-000756 DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000757 IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000758 BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
cv-valid-train-sample-000759 FEBRUARY TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES
cv-valid-train-sample-000760 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000761 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000762 THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
cv-valid-train-sample-000763 UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000764 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
cv-valid-train-sample-000765 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ROMANTIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000766 THE FOOTBALL JOCKS LAUGHED VICIOUSLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000767 YOU'RE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000768 THE ELEVATORS ARE STILL RUNNING
cv-valid-train-sample-000769 BUT USE THEM TO BUY YOUR FLOCK
cv-valid-train-sample-000770 THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
cv-valid-train-sample-000771 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000772 BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM
cv-valid-train-sample-000773 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000774 THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
cv-valid-train-sample-000775 HAVE YOU GOT A MIRROR
cv-valid-train-sample-000776 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000777 THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000778 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000779 THE PILOTS BRACED THEMSELVES FOR IMPACT
cv-valid-train-sample-000780 IT WAS A A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
cv-valid-train-sample-000781 LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000782 HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
cv-valid-train-sample-000783 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
cv-valid-train-sample-000784 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
cv-valid-train-sample-000785 HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000786 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
cv-valid-train-sample-000787 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
cv-valid-train-sample-000788 I CAN EXPLAIN IF YOU'LL JUST LISTEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000789 THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
cv-valid-train-sample-000790 IT'S NOT A LIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000791 IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
cv-valid-train-sample-000792 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000793 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000794 NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000795 HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000796 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000797 JUST AS A RULE OF THUMB
cv-valid-train-sample-000798 I REALLY DID IT QUITE BRILLIANTLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000799 AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
