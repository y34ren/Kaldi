cv-valid-train-sample-000200 THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000201 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000202 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000203 I KNOW ITS DIMENSIONS AND HOW IT BEHAVES
cv-valid-train-sample-000204 OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT
cv-valid-train-sample-000205 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000206 TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000207 GET DOWN QUICK
cv-valid-train-sample-000208 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000209 HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HOLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000210 YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
cv-valid-train-sample-000211 IT WAS HARASSMENT PURE AND SIMPLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000212 THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS CAPE AND THE BOY WAS STRUCK BY WHAT HE SAW
cv-valid-train-sample-000213 HOW WAS THAT FOR A TIGHT SQUEEZE
cv-valid-train-sample-000214 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
cv-valid-train-sample-000215 WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000216 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000217 GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SEASON
cv-valid-train-sample-000218 THE DISPLAY WAS UNDERWHELMING
cv-valid-train-sample-000219 NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FELLOWS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
cv-valid-train-sample-000220 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000221 THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000222 I'M GONNA BUILD AIR FIELDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000223 HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000224 A POX UPON ME FOR A CLUMSY THING
cv-valid-train-sample-000225 STOVE'S HOTTER THAN I THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000226 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000227 THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF
cv-valid-train-sample-000228 IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
cv-valid-train-sample-000229 YOU THINK IT'S EASY
cv-valid-train-sample-000230 THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
cv-valid-train-sample-000231 I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000232 THE WIRELESS JOYPAD WAS EXPERIENCING CONNECTION ISSUES
cv-valid-train-sample-000233 AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000234 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000235 IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000236 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000237 THAT'S WHY ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE NICE
cv-valid-train-sample-000238 THIS IS A TRICK TO GET YOUR SYMPATHY
cv-valid-train-sample-000239 IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000240 THE SHOP WAS BUSY AND THE MAN ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON
cv-valid-train-sample-000241 SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000242 TONIGHT THEY WOULD FIND OUT THE TRUTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000243 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
cv-valid-train-sample-000244 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000245 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000246 HE HAD ASSUMED HE WOULD SOON RETURN TO HIS SHEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000247 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
cv-valid-train-sample-000248 NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000249 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000250 HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000251 I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000252 THIS IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION SHELDON SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000253 I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
cv-valid-train-sample-000254 IT ALL HAPPENED RATHER SUDDENLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000255 SURE SEE YOU THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000256 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train-sample-000257 A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK
cv-valid-train-sample-000258 HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
cv-valid-train-sample-000259 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000260 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
cv-valid-train-sample-000261 PATRICK HAS TERMINAL CANCER
cv-valid-train-sample-000262 THIS IS JON DAVIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000263 THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000264 ONE AFTERNOON ONE OF HIS SERVANTS FELL ILL AND IT APPEARED THAT HE WOULD DIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000265 ACCORDING TO THE PREDOMINANT NOTION IN THE VATICAN CONDOMS SHOULDN'T BE USED IN SPITE OF HIV
cv-valid-train-sample-000266 BUT YOU ARE FORCING ME TO LOOK AT WEALTH AND AT HORIZONS I HAVE NEVER KNOWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000267 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
cv-valid-train-sample-000268 HE PAID FOR THE WOOL AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000269 THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000270 AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000271 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
cv-valid-train-sample-000272 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000273 I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
cv-valid-train-sample-000274 I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000275 MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY
cv-valid-train-sample-000276 ARABS OFTEN APPEARED IN THE CITY SHOPPING AND CHANTING THEIR STRANGE PRAYERS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000277 THERE IS A REPTILE IN MY WESTERN SHOES
cv-valid-train-sample-000278 HOW ARE YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000279 I WANT TO STAY AT THE OASIS THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000280 AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
cv-valid-train-sample-000281 WHAT'S IN THAT DESK
cv-valid-train-sample-000282 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000283 I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000284 THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000285 SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
cv-valid-train-sample-000286 DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AT AN ABANDONED CHURCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000287 EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000288 BECAUSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WOULD FIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000289 IN HIS HEART HE WANTED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO SLEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000290 THE BOY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000291 THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000292 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000293 WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000294 THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000295 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
cv-valid-train-sample-000296 THE BOY SWORE THAT EVERY TIME HE HEARD THE ALARM HE WOULD HEED ITS MESSAGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000297 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
cv-valid-train-sample-000298 I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000299 WE CAN ONLY PERCEIVE A PART OF THE BROAD LIGHT SPECTRUM THE SUN EMITS
