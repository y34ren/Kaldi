cv-valid-train-sample-000800 GET ME WALTER BURNS
cv-valid-train-sample-000801 HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF
cv-valid-train-sample-000802 PEOPLE CONTINUED TO COME AND GO FROM THE BAKER'S SHOP
cv-valid-train-sample-000803 THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
cv-valid-train-sample-000804 YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000805 WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
cv-valid-train-sample-000806 FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000807 I WISH YOU'D FORGET ABOUT US
cv-valid-train-sample-000808 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000809 THE BOOK THAT MOST INTERESTED THE BOY TOLD THE STORIES OF THE FAMOUS ALCHEMISTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000810 ARE YOU CRAZY THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON
cv-valid-train-sample-000811 THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING
cv-valid-train-sample-000812 MY ALLERGY HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE TODAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000813 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING AND LOAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000814 BEEN SEEING ME IN YOUR DREAMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000815 THE STRANGER WITHDREW THE SWORD FROM THE BOY'S FOREHEAD AND THE BOY FELT IMMENSELY RELIEVED
cv-valid-train-sample-000816 SHE NEVER GREW UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000817 THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
cv-valid-train-sample-000818 FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
cv-valid-train-sample-000819 MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000820 SAME WAY YOU DID
cv-valid-train-sample-000821 THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000822 WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000823 AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
cv-valid-train-sample-000824 I WANT THOSE STAMPS
cv-valid-train-sample-000825 I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000826 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
cv-valid-train-sample-000827 THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000828 MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
cv-valid-train-sample-000829 BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train-sample-000830 YOU WILL NEVER REOPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000831 YOU DONT COMPARE DIRECTLY TO EXISTING STATEOFTHEART METHODS
cv-valid-train-sample-000832 BUT HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DESIRE THAT AN ARMY INVADE THE OASIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000833 I'M SMOKING TOO MUCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000834 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000835 AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000836 THE TEA SEEMED LESS BITTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000837 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000838 NOT TO WORRY SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000839 EARLIER THIS YEAR WE FOUND A REALLY NICE PLACE NEAR MY OFFICE AND WE MOVED IN TOGETHER
cv-valid-train-sample-000840 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train-sample-000841 THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000842 WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000843 TWO DAYS AGO YOU SAID THAT I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TRAVEL THE MERCHANT ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000844 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000845 HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS WERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000846 MECCA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000847 THAT NIGHT HE TOLD ALL OF THIS TO THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000848 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000849 FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000850 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000851 THE ALCHEMIST ERASED THE CIRCLE IN THE SAND AND THE SNAKE SLITHERED AWAY AMONG THE ROCKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000852 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000853 I'M AFRAID THE JOKE'S ON US
cv-valid-train-sample-000854 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000855 THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000856 THE BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS A SURPRISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000857 THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000858 YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000859 AND WHAT A WAY TO QUIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000860 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000861 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000862 AND STOP THREATENING THAT BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000863 THEN HE TURNED TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000864 FOR USERS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY CAN TRUST THEIR OPERATING SYSTEM
cv-valid-train-sample-000865 WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO TO MECCA NOW ASKED THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000866 THE MONK WAS IRRITATED
cv-valid-train-sample-000867 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000868 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000869 CAN'T YOU READ ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000870 ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000871 DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000872 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000873 THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000874 HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
cv-valid-train-sample-000875 WILL YOU GIVE ME THOSE STAMPS
cv-valid-train-sample-000876 I LEFT HER HANGING AROUND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS
cv-valid-train-sample-000877 HE HAD BEEN TO THE VILLAGE ONLY ONCE THE YEAR BEFORE
cv-valid-train-sample-000878 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000879 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000880 WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000881 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000882 LOOK AT THOSE SHOULDERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000883 THE SUN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE
cv-valid-train-sample-000884 SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000885 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000886 I WILL BE BACK SOON
cv-valid-train-sample-000887 WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000888 MRS SARAH DOESN'T EITHER
cv-valid-train-sample-000889 WELLI DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000890 HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000891 I THOUGHT YOU WERE CHASING ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000892 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
cv-valid-train-sample-000893 NOTE THAT IT DOES HAVE BUILTIN SUPPORT FOR WEB BROWSING ALTHOUGH I FIND IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL
cv-valid-train-sample-000894 THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
cv-valid-train-sample-000895 THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT SORTS OF FUEL AT THIS GAS STATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000896 I GOTTA FIGURE SOME WAY OUT OF THIS THING
cv-valid-train-sample-000897 IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000898 THIS BEHAVIOR OF NEURAL NETWORKS IS SOMETIMES CALLED DREAMING
cv-valid-train-sample-000899 DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON
