cv-valid-train-sample-000400 I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THAT TUB
cv-valid-train-sample-000401 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000402 THIS DESERT WAS ONCE A SEA HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000403 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000404 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000405 HE HAD NO IDEA HOW HE WAS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000406 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
cv-valid-train-sample-000407 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000408 THAT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000409 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000410 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
cv-valid-train-sample-000411 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
cv-valid-train-sample-000412 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000413 SHE JOINED UP TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000414 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000415 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
cv-valid-train-sample-000416 THERE'S LIFE HERE THE BOY SAID TO THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000417 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
cv-valid-train-sample-000418 I'M GOING TO THEM
cv-valid-train-sample-000419 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000420 IT BELONGS TO ME NOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000421 HAS HE BEEN HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000422 BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
cv-valid-train-sample-000423 YOU SAID YOU WANTED FIREWORKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000424 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
cv-valid-train-sample-000425 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
cv-valid-train-sample-000426 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train-sample-000427 I WISH THEY WERE TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000428 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
cv-valid-train-sample-000429 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
cv-valid-train-sample-000430 THEY WERE ALWAYS JUST SOMEBODY TO FILL UP THE BLEACHERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000431 DONT FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE IT WOULD NOT HELP
cv-valid-train-sample-000432 THERE WAS A SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE STATUE
cv-valid-train-sample-000433 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000434 HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000435 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000436 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000437 NOBODY'S TRYING TO STEAL FROM YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000438 BUT HE FOUND IT MUCH MORE INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THE CARAVAN AND LISTEN TO THE WIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000439 IT CONSIDERS THE HORIZONTAL DIMENSION AS TIME
cv-valid-train-sample-000440 HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED
cv-valid-train-sample-000441 ALWAYS HEED THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000442 IT COMMENCED TO BLOW HARDER RAISING THE DESERT SANDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000443 WELL WHAT GOOD WOULD IT BE TO YOU IF YOU HAD T DIE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000444 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000445 CAROL SAVED HER BROTHER'S LIFE THAT DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000446 IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000447 THAT HE HAD ATTENDED A SEMINARY UNTIL HE WAS SIXTEEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000448 I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000449 KEEP HIM IN HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000450 MAYBE TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER THAN YESTERDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000451 SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALEX PRETTY WELL
cv-valid-train-sample-000452 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000453 WHEN THE SIMUM CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000454 THE FOREST BURNED FOR THIRTEEN DAYS
cv-valid-train-sample-000455 WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000456 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-train-sample-000457 HE WASHED THE DETRITUS FROM HIS HAIR
cv-valid-train-sample-000458 THAT'S WHAT ALCHEMISTS DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000459 HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000460 THE RESTAURANT WAS QUITE EXPENSIVE
cv-valid-train-sample-000461 PHONE THE NEWSPAPERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000462 HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
cv-valid-train-sample-000463 HE AROSE AND TAKING UP HIS CROOK BEGAN TO AWAKEN THE SHEEP THAT STILL SLEPT
cv-valid-train-sample-000464 THE SHEPHERD SWORE THAT HE WOULD
cv-valid-train-sample-000465 AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000466 MAKTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000467 I DIDN'T FRISK HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000468 HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000469 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
cv-valid-train-sample-000470 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
cv-valid-train-sample-000471 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000472 I'M LEAVING TODAY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000473 THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000474 I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000475 AND TOMORROW HIS ENEMY WOULD ALSO BE A PART OF THAT SOUL
cv-valid-train-sample-000476 I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000477 SO THEN TRY HE SAID TO THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000478 I DON'T BELIEVE IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000479 THE VIRUS SPREAD FASTER THAN WILDFIRE
cv-valid-train-sample-000480 THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000481 I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000482 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000483 PERHAPS SHE MET SOMEBODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000484 TAKE YOUR PAWS OFF ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000485 APPLE PIE IS AN ICONIC DISH
cv-valid-train-sample-000486 AM I GOING TO FIND MY TREASURE HE ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000487 THE ACHIEVED RESULTS ARE FAR BEHIND THE STATEOFTHEART IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000488 THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
cv-valid-train-sample-000489 COACH HAS HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000490 THE SUN WAS TURNED INTO A GOLDEN DISK
cv-valid-train-sample-000491 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000492 THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
cv-valid-train-sample-000493 AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000494 IF HE ABANDONS THAT PURSUIT IT'S BECAUSE IT WASN'T TRUELOVE
cv-valid-train-sample-000495 THE OASIS IS NEUTRAL GROUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000496 WHAT DO YOU SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000497 I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000498 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
cv-valid-train-sample-000499 SURE I KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES
