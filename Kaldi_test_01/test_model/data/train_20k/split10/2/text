cv-valid-train-sample-000100 HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
cv-valid-train-sample-000101 THE FUMES FROM THE TRAFFIC WAS UNBEARABLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000102 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
cv-valid-train-sample-000103 THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
cv-valid-train-sample-000104 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000105 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY APPARENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000106 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000107 THE ENGLISHMAN HAD SEVERAL SUITCASES FILLED WITH BOOKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000108 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train-sample-000109 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000110 WISH I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000111 HE STILL CALLS HIS MOTHER MUMMY
cv-valid-train-sample-000112 IT'S COMMON TO RUN INTO PROBLEMS SO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000113 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000114 THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000115 HARRY'LL TEAR HIS DINNER SUIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000116 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000117 YOU'VE GOT HIS GUN
cv-valid-train-sample-000118 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
cv-valid-train-sample-000119 IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT IT MATTERS A LOT
cv-valid-train-sample-000120 WE MUST BE GOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000121 WATCH OVER HER TONIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000122 DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE
cv-valid-train-sample-000123 THERE'S A MOON OUT TONIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000124 THE BOY REPEATED HIS QUESTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000125 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000126 YOU'RE A WEEK LATE FOR SCHOOL ALREADY
cv-valid-train-sample-000127 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
cv-valid-train-sample-000128 YOU HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR DREAMS ABOUT THE OLD KING AND YOUR TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000129 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
cv-valid-train-sample-000130 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000131 THE LEVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
cv-valid-train-sample-000132 WITH THE GIRL WITH THE RAVEN HAIR HIS DAYS WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000133 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
cv-valid-train-sample-000134 WEAR THE BLUE ONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000135 LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOURLEAF CLOVERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000136 I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000137 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000138 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000139 THE TWO WALKED OUT AMONG THE PALMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000140 HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000141 THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000142 MEN HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS OF THE WISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000143 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000144 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000145 GET THE BULLETIN BOARD
cv-valid-train-sample-000146 THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000147 YOU TOLD ME THAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000148 NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
cv-valid-train-sample-000149 DO YOU WANT TO WAKE THAT BABY
cv-valid-train-sample-000150 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000151 I NEVER STOLE A WATCH IN MY LIFE
cv-valid-train-sample-000152 GOOD LUCK TO YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000153 MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000154 I WAS JUST ASKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000155 LET HIM HAVE EVERYTHING HE WANTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000156 THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000157 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000158 EGYPT IS A COUNTRY THAT IS OFTEN MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000159 HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
cv-valid-train-sample-000160 THE BOY KNEW AND WAS NOW WORKING TOWARD IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000161 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000162 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000163 THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
cv-valid-train-sample-000164 IT IS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000165 THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
cv-valid-train-sample-000166 WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
cv-valid-train-sample-000167 THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
cv-valid-train-sample-000168 THE ALARM CLOCK WAS SET FOR TWENTY PAST THREE
cv-valid-train-sample-000169 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000170 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000171 THE BOY WENT TO THE WELL EVERY DAY TO MEET WITH FATIMA
cv-valid-train-sample-000172 IT'S THE NAME OF THE PROPHET'S DAUGHTER FATIMA SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000173 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000174 THE BOY REMEMBERED HIS DREAM AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR TO HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000175 GET SOME WATER QUICKLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000176 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
cv-valid-train-sample-000177 THERE WAS A LOUD SHRIEK FROM A WOMAN STANDING BEHIND US
cv-valid-train-sample-000178 THEN LEAVE WITH THE CARAVAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000179 HE IS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND JUST TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000180 YOU'RE STILL A GOOD REPORTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000181 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000182 THERE ISN'T ANY MORE WINE
cv-valid-train-sample-000183 DOES THIS BELONG TO YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000184 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000185 THEY WANTED TO SAVE THE OASIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000186 TWO HORSEMEN WAITING AHEAD OF THEM
cv-valid-train-sample-000187 I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000188 I DON'T MUCH LIKE CHANGE HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000189 THE DUNES ARE CHANGED BY THE WIND BUT THE DESERT NEVER CHANGES
cv-valid-train-sample-000190 SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS
cv-valid-train-sample-000191 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000192 HE'S IN MY ROOM
cv-valid-train-sample-000193 IS SHE AS GOOD AS YOU SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000194 THEY FILLED THREE SACKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000195 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000196 THIS IS THE MORNING POST YOU'RE TALKING TO
cv-valid-train-sample-000197 YOU WILL SPEND THAT HOUR GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH MARSHALL BAILEY
cv-valid-train-sample-000198 THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000199 IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
