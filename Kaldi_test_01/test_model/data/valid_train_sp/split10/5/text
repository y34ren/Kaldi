sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000200 THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000201 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000202 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000203 I KNOW ITS DIMENSIONS AND HOW IT BEHAVES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000204 OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000205 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000206 TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000207 GET DOWN QUICK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000208 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000209 HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HOLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000210 YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000211 IT WAS HARASSMENT PURE AND SIMPLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000212 THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS CAPE AND THE BOY WAS STRUCK BY WHAT HE SAW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000213 HOW WAS THAT FOR A TIGHT SQUEEZE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000214 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000215 WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000216 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000217 GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SEASON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000218 THE DISPLAY WAS UNDERWHELMING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000219 NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FELLOWS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000220 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000221 THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000222 I'M GONNA BUILD AIR FIELDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000223 HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000224 A POX UPON ME FOR A CLUMSY THING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000225 STOVE'S HOTTER THAN I THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000226 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000227 THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000228 IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000229 YOU THINK IT'S EASY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000230 THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000231 I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000232 THE WIRELESS JOYPAD WAS EXPERIENCING CONNECTION ISSUES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000233 AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000234 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000235 IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000236 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000237 THAT'S WHY ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE NICE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000238 THIS IS A TRICK TO GET YOUR SYMPATHY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000239 IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000240 THE SHOP WAS BUSY AND THE MAN ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000241 SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000242 TONIGHT THEY WOULD FIND OUT THE TRUTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000243 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000244 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000245 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000246 HE HAD ASSUMED HE WOULD SOON RETURN TO HIS SHEEP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000247 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000248 NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000249 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000250 HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000251 I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000252 THIS IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION SHELDON SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000253 I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000254 IT ALL HAPPENED RATHER SUDDENLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000255 SURE SEE YOU THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000256 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000257 A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000258 HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000259 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000260 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000261 PATRICK HAS TERMINAL CANCER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000262 THIS IS JON DAVIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000263 THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000264 ONE AFTERNOON ONE OF HIS SERVANTS FELL ILL AND IT APPEARED THAT HE WOULD DIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000265 ACCORDING TO THE PREDOMINANT NOTION IN THE VATICAN CONDOMS SHOULDN'T BE USED IN SPITE OF HIV
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000266 BUT YOU ARE FORCING ME TO LOOK AT WEALTH AND AT HORIZONS I HAVE NEVER KNOWN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000267 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000268 HE PAID FOR THE WOOL AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000269 THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000270 AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000271 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000272 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000273 I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000274 I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000275 MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000276 ARABS OFTEN APPEARED IN THE CITY SHOPPING AND CHANTING THEIR STRANGE PRAYERS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000277 THERE IS A REPTILE IN MY WESTERN SHOES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000278 HOW ARE YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000279 I WANT TO STAY AT THE OASIS THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000280 AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000281 WHAT'S IN THAT DESK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000282 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000283 I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000284 THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000285 SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000286 DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AT AN ABANDONED CHURCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000287 EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000288 BECAUSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WOULD FIND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000289 IN HIS HEART HE WANTED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO SLEEP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000290 THE BOY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000291 THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000292 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000293 WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000294 THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000295 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000296 THE BOY SWORE THAT EVERY TIME HE HEARD THE ALARM HE WOULD HEED ITS MESSAGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000297 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000298 I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000299 WE CAN ONLY PERCEIVE A PART OF THE BROAD LIGHT SPECTRUM THE SUN EMITS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000300 THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000301 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000302 FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000303 I DON'T KNOW YOU FROM ADAM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000304 THEY WERE RACING DOWN THE STREETS WITH NO REGARD FOR ANYONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000305 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000306 IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000307 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000308 THERESA COULDN'T FEEL ANY MORE DUMB RIGHT NOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000309 HE'S ALLERGIC TO HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000310 I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET SOME STYLISH UNDERWEAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000311 THIRTY EVERY THURSDAY SIXTY AT SIXTY WHO KNOWS WHAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000312 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000313 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000314 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000315 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000316 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000317 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000318 THERE'S A LOT MORE YOU CAN DO WITH A TIGHTER INTEGRATION WITH THE EYE TRACKING API
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000319 HE KNEW WHAT I WAS THINKING THE BOY SAID TO HIMSELF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000320 WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO WRITE ABOUT HILLARY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000321 HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000322 JOHNATHAN ASSESSED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000323 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000324 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000325 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000326 HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THE STRANGE LAND HE WAS IN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000327 FROM THAT DAY ON IT WAS THE DESERT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000328 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000329 AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE MAN LIVED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000330 IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000331 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000332 IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELED BY FIREWOOD WITH A TRANSPARENT FLASK HEATING ON TOP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000333 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000334 SO IMMERSE YOURSELF IN IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000335 WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000336 BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000337 HIS NAME IS WELCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000338 THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000339 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000340 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000341 THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000342 THE MAN LOOKED AT THE ANGEL IN SURPRISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000343 BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000344 THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MORE TEA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000345 THAT WAS HIS WORK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000346 WHAT YOUR HUSBAND WAS MIXED UP IN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000347 THE BOY RECALLED THE BRILLIANCE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000348 IF I'M ON THE MARCH I JUST CONCENTRATE ON MARCHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000349 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000350 THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000351 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000352 IT'S THE ONLY ONE THEY HAD LEFT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000353 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000354 HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000355 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000356 THERE WAS NO OTHER BAGGAGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000357 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000358 DID YOU SAY A KING HE ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000359 WHAT HE SAID REMINDED THE BOY OF THE OLD KING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000360 BUT WE COULD SELL TEA IN CRYSTAL GLASSES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000361 HE WAS THINKING ABOUT OMENS AND SOMEONE HAD APPEARED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000362 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000363 IN THE DISCOTHEQUE THE DJ PLAYED PROGRESSIVE HOUSE MUSIC AND TRANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000364 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000365 I'VE WATCHED YOU GROW UP FROM A LITTLE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000366 IT'S THE ONLY NAME I'VE GOT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000367 THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000368 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000369 I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000370 IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000371 THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000372 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000373 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000374 BUT AS TIME PASSED TANGIER HAD CHANGED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000375 MY KEYCHAIN IS HEAVY AND AWKWARD TO CARRY IN MY POCKET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000376 I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000377 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000378 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000379 I KNOW THAT GIRL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000380 HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000381 BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000382 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000383 LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000384 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000385 HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000386 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000387 HOW COULD HE BE A FAKE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000388 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000389 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000390 ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000391 I FEEL LIKE A BOOTLEGGER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000392 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000393 THEN GET OUT OF HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000394 THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000395 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000396 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000397 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000398 YOU ALL KNOW ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000399 WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PLODDING THROUGH SOME USER INTERVIEWS AT THE MOMENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000400 I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THAT TUB
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000401 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000402 THIS DESERT WAS ONCE A SEA HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000403 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000404 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000405 HE HAD NO IDEA HOW HE WAS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000406 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000407 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000408 THAT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000409 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000410 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000411 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000412 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000413 SHE JOINED UP TOO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000414 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000415 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000416 THERE'S LIFE HERE THE BOY SAID TO THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000417 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000418 I'M GOING TO THEM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000419 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000420 IT BELONGS TO ME NOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000421 HAS HE BEEN HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000422 BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000423 YOU SAID YOU WANTED FIREWORKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000424 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000425 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000426 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000427 I WISH THEY WERE TOO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000428 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000429 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000430 THEY WERE ALWAYS JUST SOMEBODY TO FILL UP THE BLEACHERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000431 DONT FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE IT WOULD NOT HELP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000432 THERE WAS A SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE STATUE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000433 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000434 HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000435 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000436 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000437 NOBODY'S TRYING TO STEAL FROM YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000438 BUT HE FOUND IT MUCH MORE INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THE CARAVAN AND LISTEN TO THE WIND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000439 IT CONSIDERS THE HORIZONTAL DIMENSION AS TIME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000440 HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000441 ALWAYS HEED THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000442 IT COMMENCED TO BLOW HARDER RAISING THE DESERT SANDS
