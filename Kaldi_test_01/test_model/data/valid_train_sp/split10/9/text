sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000400 I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THAT TUB
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000401 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000402 THIS DESERT WAS ONCE A SEA HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000403 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000404 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000405 HE HAD NO IDEA HOW HE WAS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000406 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000407 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000408 THAT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000409 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000410 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000411 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000412 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000413 SHE JOINED UP TOO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000414 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000415 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000416 THERE'S LIFE HERE THE BOY SAID TO THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000417 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000418 I'M GOING TO THEM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000419 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000420 IT BELONGS TO ME NOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000421 HAS HE BEEN HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000422 BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000423 YOU SAID YOU WANTED FIREWORKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000424 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000425 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000426 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000427 I WISH THEY WERE TOO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000428 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000429 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000430 THEY WERE ALWAYS JUST SOMEBODY TO FILL UP THE BLEACHERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000431 DONT FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE IT WOULD NOT HELP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000432 THERE WAS A SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE STATUE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000433 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000434 HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000435 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000436 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000437 NOBODY'S TRYING TO STEAL FROM YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000438 BUT HE FOUND IT MUCH MORE INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THE CARAVAN AND LISTEN TO THE WIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000439 IT CONSIDERS THE HORIZONTAL DIMENSION AS TIME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000440 HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000441 ALWAYS HEED THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000442 IT COMMENCED TO BLOW HARDER RAISING THE DESERT SANDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000443 WELL WHAT GOOD WOULD IT BE TO YOU IF YOU HAD T DIE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000444 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000445 CAROL SAVED HER BROTHER'S LIFE THAT DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000446 IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000447 THAT HE HAD ATTENDED A SEMINARY UNTIL HE WAS SIXTEEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000448 I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000449 KEEP HIM IN HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000450 MAYBE TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER THAN YESTERDAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000451 SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALEX PRETTY WELL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000452 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000453 WHEN THE SIMUM CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000454 THE FOREST BURNED FOR THIRTEEN DAYS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000455 WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000456 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000457 HE WASHED THE DETRITUS FROM HIS HAIR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000458 THAT'S WHAT ALCHEMISTS DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000459 HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000460 THE RESTAURANT WAS QUITE EXPENSIVE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000461 PHONE THE NEWSPAPERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000462 HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000463 HE AROSE AND TAKING UP HIS CROOK BEGAN TO AWAKEN THE SHEEP THAT STILL SLEPT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000464 THE SHEPHERD SWORE THAT HE WOULD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000465 AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000466 MAKTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000467 I DIDN'T FRISK HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000468 HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000469 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000470 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000471 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000472 I'M LEAVING TODAY SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000473 THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000474 I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000475 AND TOMORROW HIS ENEMY WOULD ALSO BE A PART OF THAT SOUL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000476 I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000477 SO THEN TRY HE SAID TO THE ENGLISHMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000478 I DON'T BELIEVE IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000479 THE VIRUS SPREAD FASTER THAN WILDFIRE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000480 THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000481 I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000482 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000483 PERHAPS SHE MET SOMEBODY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000484 TAKE YOUR PAWS OFF ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000485 APPLE PIE IS AN ICONIC DISH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000486 AM I GOING TO FIND MY TREASURE HE ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000487 THE ACHIEVED RESULTS ARE FAR BEHIND THE STATEOFTHEART IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000488 THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000489 COACH HAS HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000490 THE SUN WAS TURNED INTO A GOLDEN DISK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000491 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000492 THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000493 AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000494 IF HE ABANDONS THAT PURSUIT IT'S BECAUSE IT WASN'T TRUELOVE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000495 THE OASIS IS NEUTRAL GROUND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000496 WHAT DO YOU SAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000497 I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000498 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000499 SURE I KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000500 HE'S THE MAN THE ADS ARE WRITTEN FOR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000501 AND ABOVE ALL DON'T FORGET TO FOLLOW YOUR DESTINY THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000502 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000503 I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000504 WE WANT SOME ACTION IN THESE PICTURES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000505 SYMBOLS OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000506 THIS GUY STOLE MY WATCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000507 IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WINE HE HAD EVER TASTED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000508 IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000509 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000510 THE SPACE WAS SPARTAN ALMOST BARE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000511 DO YOU MIND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE CROWDED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000512 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000513 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000514 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000515 HE'S THE ONLY HUSBAND I'VE GOT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000516 THIS IS FOR YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000517 THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000518 HE NEVER ASKED ME TO SIT DOWN IN HIS LIFE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000519 MY NAME'S PETE DAVIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000520 PRETTY NICE NECK YOU'VE GOT THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000521 AN ARMY IS COMING THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000522 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000523 YOU MEAN HERE IN THE CITY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000524 REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOUR HEART IS THERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000525 REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOUR HEART IS THERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000526 I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000527 THE BOY APPROACHED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000528 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000529 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000530 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000531 HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000532 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000533 THE BOY FELT ILL AND TERRIBLY ALONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000534 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000535 WILL YOU EXCUSE US A MINUTE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000536 I'M LOVING IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000537 AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000538 YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000539 YOUR HEART IS ALIVE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000540 PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS VILLAGE SON SAID HIS FATHER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000541 AND THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY WELL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000542 VICTORIA DOES THINGS IN A MUCH BIGGER WAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000543 I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000544 I'D HATE TO HAVE THAT MANY PINS STUCK IN ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000545 BUT WHAT'S ALL THIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000546 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000547 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000548 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000549 HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000550 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000551 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000552 WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000553 HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000554 DOESNT IT DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF HASHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000555 AND THAT HE A BOY COULD PERFORM MIRACLES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000556 IT WON'T HURT YOU AND WE CAN MAKE THE CITY EDITION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000557 THE NAVY'S GOING TO FLY FATHER HOME THIS AFTERNOON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000558 HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000559 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000560 WE ATE SPICY RICE WITH CHICKEN LEGS AND WHITE MUSHROOMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000561 THE HEAT LASTED UNTIL NIGHTFALL AND ALL THAT TIME HE HAD TO CARRY HIS JACKET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000562 AND I'LL SIGN A PAPER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000563 THAT'S AN INHERENT DISADVANTAGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000564 I'D BETTER HUSTLE HIM UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000565 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000566 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000567 I'M AFRAID SHE'D FEEL ASHAMED TO THINK SHE HADN'T TRUSTED YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000568 BUT I'M GOING TO EGYPT THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000569 WHAT WERE YOU WHEN YOU CAME HERE FIVE YEARS AGO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000570 I GOT IT BACK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000571 I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000572 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000573 FASTFOOD IS CONVENIENT BUT OFTEN UNHEALTHY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000574 HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE MORNING'S MEETING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000575 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000576 THE NEARBY CITY OF CEUTA HAD GROWN FASTER THAN TANGIER AND BUSINESS HAD FALLEN OFF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000577 HE'S DEPOSITED TEN DOLLARS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000578 ONLY US EXPLORERS CAN GET IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000579 JUST A MEMORY RIGHT NOW IT SIGNIFIED SHADE WATER AND A REFUGE FROM THE WAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000580 THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000581 DIDN'T I TELL YOU NEVER TO COME PANHANDLING AROUND HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000582 THIS WILL HELP YOU EFFECTIVELY COLLABORATE WITH DEVELOPERS AND COORDINATE CROSSTEAM PROJECTS THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000583 BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000584 BUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT HAD NO CHOICE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000585 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000586 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000587 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000588 THE MAN WEPT WITH HAPPINESS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000589 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000590 COME IN AGAIN SOME TIME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000591 RAISINS ARE DELICIOUS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000592 HE WANTED YOUR MONEY HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000593 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000594 MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000595 YOU MUSTN'T LET WHAT SHE SAID BOTHER YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000596 SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME THE SUN ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000597 HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU GET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000598 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000599 HOW DO I GUESS AT THE FUTURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000600 LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000601 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000602 DON'T MIND THE COLONEL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000603 HE THOUGHT OF ALL THE MARRIED SHEPHERDS HE HAD KNOWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000604 I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000605 AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000606 WHAT IS A FOREIGNER DOING HERE ASKED ANOTHER OF THE MEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000607 AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000608 THERE'S THAT REPRIEVE IF THEY EVER FIND OUT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000609 THREE DAYS FROM NOW HE WOULD BE WITH THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000610 IF YOU DON'T STOP FOLLOWING ME I'LL CALL THE POLICE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000611 BUT MAYBE PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT WAY HAD NEVER LEARNED THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000612 BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000613 LOOKS LIKE ABOUT TEN YEARS A PIECE FOR YOU BIRDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000614 HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000615 THE OTHER SON WAS A POET AND DELIGHTED ALL OF ROME WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL VERSES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000616 HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000617 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000618 ONE MUST PREPARE FOR IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000619 BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUMNI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000620 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000621 IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000622 A MAN DOESN'T GET IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS EVERY DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000623 CAN I GET A WOOT WOOT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000624 I THINK IT'S ABOUT BIRD HUNTING BUT NOW I CAN SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000625 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000626 SUNBURNS CAN BE AVOIDED BY APPLYING SUNSCREEN OR BY STAYING IN THE SHADOWS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000627 IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000628 IF HE EVER DECIDED TO LEAVE THEM THEY WOULD SUFFER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000629 TAKE CHARGE OF HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000630 I LOST MY WALLET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000631 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000632 HE'S NUTS ABOUT YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000633 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000634 I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRANSMITTED BY WORD OF MOUTH HE THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000635 IT'S THE OTHER FOREIGNER THE ENGLISHMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000636 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000637 THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOSED OFF THE CONVERSATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000638 YOU'LL NEVER GET IT OUT OF ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000639 IT WAS THE PURE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000640 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000641 I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000642 I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CHANGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000643 IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000644 THEY WENT TO THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE MONASTERY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000645 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
