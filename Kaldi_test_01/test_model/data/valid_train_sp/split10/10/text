sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000700 THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000701 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000702 BECAUSE HE WAS TERRIFIED THE BOY DIDN'T ANSWER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000703 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000704 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000705 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000706 IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000707 WHAT GOOD IS MONEY TO YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000708 THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000709 SORT OF A JACK LONDON STYLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000710 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000711 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000712 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000713 BUT HE GRANTED THE TRAVELERS THREE DAYS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000714 WELL THEN HELP ME DO THAT THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000715 I AM HERE THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000716 THE ARROW WAS POINTING TO THE EXIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000717 I'M GOING TO GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE DESERT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000718 DO YOU SEE THIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000719 THEY WERE TRIBESMEN DRESSED IN BLUE WITH BLACK RINGS SURROUNDING THEIR TURBANS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000720 THE LIBRARY IS OPEN TO EVERYONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000721 THAT'S COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000722 IT WAS A TENT LIKE MANY AT THE OASIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000723 HE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE PRACTICAL MATTERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000724 SHE WROTE THE STUFF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000725 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000726 THE HOOKAHS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUARDS STOOD AT ATTENTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000727 ANOTHER WHO WAS SEARCHING THE BOY'S BAGS FOUND THE PIECE OF GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000728 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000729 I NEVER SAW AMANDA ACT LIKE THAT BEFORE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000730 THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO COOL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000731 OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000732 FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000733 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000734 BECAUSE NOW HE KNEW WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000735 DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET HIDING PLACE HERE IN THE HOUSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000736 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000737 I'M GOING TO NEED IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000738 I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000739 I BET YOU FORGOT THE WINE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000740 NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000741 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000742 THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000743 AS HE WAS LEAVING HE SAW IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM HIS OLD SHEPHERD'S POUCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000744 IS THERE A MRS JOSHUA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000745 I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000746 YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000747 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000748 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000749 THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000750 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000751 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000752 THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000753 WHAT TRICKS WOULD I PULL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000754 THIS SOLUTION ALSO WORKS WELL IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL A LINUX DISTRO ON WINDOWS VIA VIRTUALIZATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000755 BECAUSE FOR HIM YOU ARE A GREEN FIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000756 DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000757 IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000758 BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000759 FEBRUARY TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000760 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000761 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000762 THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000763 UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000764 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000765 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ROMANTIC
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000766 THE FOOTBALL JOCKS LAUGHED VICIOUSLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000767 YOU'RE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000768 THE ELEVATORS ARE STILL RUNNING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000769 BUT USE THEM TO BUY YOUR FLOCK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000770 THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000771 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000772 BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000773 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000774 THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000775 HAVE YOU GOT A MIRROR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000776 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000777 THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000778 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000779 THE PILOTS BRACED THEMSELVES FOR IMPACT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000780 IT WAS A A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000781 LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000782 HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000783 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000784 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000785 HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000786 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000787 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000788 I CAN EXPLAIN IF YOU'LL JUST LISTEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000789 THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000790 IT'S NOT A LIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000791 IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000792 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000793 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000794 NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000795 HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000796 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000797 JUST AS A RULE OF THUMB
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000798 I REALLY DID IT QUITE BRILLIANTLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000799 AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000800 GET ME WALTER BURNS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000801 HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000802 PEOPLE CONTINUED TO COME AND GO FROM THE BAKER'S SHOP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000803 THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000804 YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000805 WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000806 FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000807 I WISH YOU'D FORGET ABOUT US
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000808 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000809 THE BOOK THAT MOST INTERESTED THE BOY TOLD THE STORIES OF THE FAMOUS ALCHEMISTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000810 ARE YOU CRAZY THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000811 THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000812 MY ALLERGY HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE TODAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000813 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING AND LOAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000814 BEEN SEEING ME IN YOUR DREAMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000815 THE STRANGER WITHDREW THE SWORD FROM THE BOY'S FOREHEAD AND THE BOY FELT IMMENSELY RELIEVED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000816 SHE NEVER GREW UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000817 THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000818 FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000819 MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000820 SAME WAY YOU DID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000821 THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000822 WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000823 AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000824 I WANT THOSE STAMPS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000825 I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000826 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000827 THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000828 MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000829 BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000830 YOU WILL NEVER REOPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000831 YOU DONT COMPARE DIRECTLY TO EXISTING STATEOFTHEART METHODS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000832 BUT HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DESIRE THAT AN ARMY INVADE THE OASIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000833 I'M SMOKING TOO MUCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000834 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000835 AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000836 THE TEA SEEMED LESS BITTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000837 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000838 NOT TO WORRY SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000839 EARLIER THIS YEAR WE FOUND A REALLY NICE PLACE NEAR MY OFFICE AND WE MOVED IN TOGETHER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000840 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000841 THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000842 WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000843 TWO DAYS AGO YOU SAID THAT I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TRAVEL THE MERCHANT ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000844 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000845 HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS WERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000846 MECCA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000847 THAT NIGHT HE TOLD ALL OF THIS TO THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000848 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000849 FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000850 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000851 THE ALCHEMIST ERASED THE CIRCLE IN THE SAND AND THE SNAKE SLITHERED AWAY AMONG THE ROCKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000852 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000853 I'M AFRAID THE JOKE'S ON US
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000854 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000855 THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000856 THE BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS A SURPRISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000857 THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000858 YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000859 AND WHAT A WAY TO QUIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000860 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000861 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000862 AND STOP THREATENING THAT BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000863 THEN HE TURNED TO THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000864 FOR USERS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY CAN TRUST THEIR OPERATING SYSTEM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000865 WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO TO MECCA NOW ASKED THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000866 THE MONK WAS IRRITATED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000867 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000868 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000869 CAN'T YOU READ ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000870 ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE BOY THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000871 DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000872 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000873 THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000874 HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000875 WILL YOU GIVE ME THOSE STAMPS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000876 I LEFT HER HANGING AROUND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000877 HE HAD BEEN TO THE VILLAGE ONLY ONCE THE YEAR BEFORE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000878 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000879 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000880 WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000881 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000882 LOOK AT THOSE SHOULDERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000883 THE SUN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000884 SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000885 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000886 I WILL BE BACK SOON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000887 WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000888 MRS SARAH DOESN'T EITHER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000889 WELLI DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000890 HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000891 I THOUGHT YOU WERE CHASING ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000892 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000893 NOTE THAT IT DOES HAVE BUILTIN SUPPORT FOR WEB BROWSING ALTHOUGH I FIND IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000894 THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000895 THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT SORTS OF FUEL AT THIS GAS STATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000896 I GOTTA FIGURE SOME WAY OUT OF THIS THING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000897 IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000898 THIS BEHAVIOR OF NEURAL NETWORKS IS SOMETIMES CALLED DREAMING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000899 DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000900 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000901 THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000902 THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000903 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000904 ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000905 I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE HIM SINCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000906 I'M AFRAID I MIGHT HAVE SOILED THE COUCH A LITTLE WITH MY SHOES EDDIE MURPHY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000907 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000908 THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SO DID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000909 WHO TOLD YOU THAT ASKED THE BOY STARTLED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000910 HE DECIDED TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000911 MY FATHER OFFERED HER A JOB
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000912 IT WAS PAPA THAT SENDS YOU FLOWERS EVERY DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000913 ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000914 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000915 I JUMPED IN TO SAVE RACHEL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000916 THAT'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000917 IS THE HEAD BETTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000918 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000919 THAT WOMAN IS GONNA BE ON THAT ROOF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000920 I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000921 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000922 HE RECITED AN OUR FATHER SILENTLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000923 THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000924 AND HERE'S A KISS FOR YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000925 WHO WROTE THAT SPEECH FOR YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000926 SAVE THAT FOR THE TRIBUNE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000927 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000928 SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000929 I DON'T LIKE SEALS ANYHOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000930 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000931 AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000932 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO LEARN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000933 YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000934 THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000935 THE SHIP APPEARED TO BE CONSTRUCTED WITH SOME FORM OF CHROMIUM EXOSKELETON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000936 NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECKPOINTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000937 IT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT GUARANTEES EVERYONE'S FREEDOM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000938 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000939 A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000940 MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000941 YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAY DIE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000942 THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000943 THEN A MAN APPROACHED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000944 BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000945 AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000946 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY ALWAYS STAY CLOSE TO ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000947 I'M AN ALCHEMIST SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M AN ALCHEMIST HE SAID AS HE PREPARED THE MEAL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000948 JENNIFER'S EXPRESSION CHANGED PULL MY FINGER SHE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000949 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000950 THE OLD MAN LEAFED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000951 I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000952 AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000953 THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000954 RELAXED AND UNHURRIED HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD WALK THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF TANGIER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000955 THE MEETING WAS OVER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000956 ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000957 THAT WASN'T AT ALL NECESSARY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000958 I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000959 WHEN HE EMERGED IT WAS WITH A YOUNG ARAB DRESSED IN WHITE AND GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000960 WERE THEY QUICK OR WERE THEY ENRAGED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000961 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000962 AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000963 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE IN HIS HEART THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO DO SO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000964 THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000965 BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TWICE WILL SURELY HAPPEN A THIRD TIME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000966 AND THIS IS WHAT YOUR SON SAID THE ANGEL TOLD THE MAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000967 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000968 WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000969 IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000970 HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000971 YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000972 IF IT WOULD SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000973 HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000974 THEY WERE ALL FURIOUS WHEN THE ESCAPADE FAILED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000975 IT ALWAYS HELPS TO BE LEARNING SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000976 WHERE ARE YOU BOUND ASKED THE YOUNG ARAB
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000977 AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000978 I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000979 I'M NOT AFRAID OF FAILING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000980 SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000981 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000982 ANY DOPE YET ON HOW HE GOT OUT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000983 THEY'RE NOT FOR SALE HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000984 THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000985 MIND IF I SIT DOWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000986 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000987 HE HAD STUDIED LATIN SPANISH AND THEOLOGY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000988 MR BEAN IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF A BRITISH COMEDY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000989 THE IDEAS SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN A MORE CONCISE AND DIRECT MANNER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000990 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000991 I'M GOING TO CHECK UP ON THAT RIGHT AWAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000992 BUTMAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000993 I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000994 EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000995 IT WAS ENGINEERING AT ITS FINEST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000996 ALL THINGS ARE ONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000997 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000998 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000999 HOW ABOUT ONCE MORE AROUND THE PARK
