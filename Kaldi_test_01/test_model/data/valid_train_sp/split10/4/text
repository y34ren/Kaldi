cv-valid-train-sample-000900 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000901 THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION
cv-valid-train-sample-000902 THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000903 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
cv-valid-train-sample-000904 ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
cv-valid-train-sample-000905 I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE HIM SINCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000906 I'M AFRAID I MIGHT HAVE SOILED THE COUCH A LITTLE WITH MY SHOES EDDIE MURPHY
cv-valid-train-sample-000907 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
cv-valid-train-sample-000908 THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SO DID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000909 WHO TOLD YOU THAT ASKED THE BOY STARTLED
cv-valid-train-sample-000910 HE DECIDED TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000911 MY FATHER OFFERED HER A JOB
cv-valid-train-sample-000912 IT WAS PAPA THAT SENDS YOU FLOWERS EVERY DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000913 ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000914 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
cv-valid-train-sample-000915 I JUMPED IN TO SAVE RACHEL
cv-valid-train-sample-000916 THAT'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000917 IS THE HEAD BETTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000918 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
cv-valid-train-sample-000919 THAT WOMAN IS GONNA BE ON THAT ROOF
cv-valid-train-sample-000920 I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
cv-valid-train-sample-000921 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000922 HE RECITED AN OUR FATHER SILENTLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000923 THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
cv-valid-train-sample-000924 AND HERE'S A KISS FOR YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000925 WHO WROTE THAT SPEECH FOR YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000926 SAVE THAT FOR THE TRIBUNE
cv-valid-train-sample-000927 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train-sample-000928 SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
cv-valid-train-sample-000929 I DON'T LIKE SEALS ANYHOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000930 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000931 AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP
cv-valid-train-sample-000932 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO LEARN
cv-valid-train-sample-000933 YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000934 THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
cv-valid-train-sample-000935 THE SHIP APPEARED TO BE CONSTRUCTED WITH SOME FORM OF CHROMIUM EXOSKELETON
cv-valid-train-sample-000936 NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECKPOINTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000937 IT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT GUARANTEES EVERYONE'S FREEDOM
cv-valid-train-sample-000938 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000939 A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000940 MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
cv-valid-train-sample-000941 YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAY DIE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000942 THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000943 THEN A MAN APPROACHED
cv-valid-train-sample-000944 BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
cv-valid-train-sample-000945 AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
cv-valid-train-sample-000946 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY ALWAYS STAY CLOSE TO ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000947 I'M AN ALCHEMIST SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M AN ALCHEMIST HE SAID AS HE PREPARED THE MEAL
cv-valid-train-sample-000948 JENNIFER'S EXPRESSION CHANGED PULL MY FINGER SHE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000949 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000950 THE OLD MAN LEAFED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
cv-valid-train-sample-000951 I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000952 AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000953 THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
cv-valid-train-sample-000954 RELAXED AND UNHURRIED HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD WALK THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF TANGIER
cv-valid-train-sample-000955 THE MEETING WAS OVER
cv-valid-train-sample-000956 ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000957 THAT WASN'T AT ALL NECESSARY
cv-valid-train-sample-000958 I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-train-sample-000959 WHEN HE EMERGED IT WAS WITH A YOUNG ARAB DRESSED IN WHITE AND GOLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000960 WERE THEY QUICK OR WERE THEY ENRAGED
cv-valid-train-sample-000961 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000962 AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
cv-valid-train-sample-000963 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE IN HIS HEART THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO DO SO
cv-valid-train-sample-000964 THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000965 BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TWICE WILL SURELY HAPPEN A THIRD TIME
cv-valid-train-sample-000966 AND THIS IS WHAT YOUR SON SAID THE ANGEL TOLD THE MAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000967 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train-sample-000968 WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS
cv-valid-train-sample-000969 IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER
cv-valid-train-sample-000970 HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000971 YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
cv-valid-train-sample-000972 IF IT WOULD SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE
cv-valid-train-sample-000973 HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
cv-valid-train-sample-000974 THEY WERE ALL FURIOUS WHEN THE ESCAPADE FAILED
cv-valid-train-sample-000975 IT ALWAYS HELPS TO BE LEARNING SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING
cv-valid-train-sample-000976 WHERE ARE YOU BOUND ASKED THE YOUNG ARAB
cv-valid-train-sample-000977 AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000978 I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000979 I'M NOT AFRAID OF FAILING
cv-valid-train-sample-000980 SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON
cv-valid-train-sample-000981 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train-sample-000982 ANY DOPE YET ON HOW HE GOT OUT
cv-valid-train-sample-000983 THEY'RE NOT FOR SALE HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000984 THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
cv-valid-train-sample-000985 MIND IF I SIT DOWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000986 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000987 HE HAD STUDIED LATIN SPANISH AND THEOLOGY
cv-valid-train-sample-000988 MR BEAN IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF A BRITISH COMEDY
cv-valid-train-sample-000989 THE IDEAS SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN A MORE CONCISE AND DIRECT MANNER
cv-valid-train-sample-000990 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
cv-valid-train-sample-000991 I'M GOING TO CHECK UP ON THAT RIGHT AWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000992 BUTMAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
cv-valid-train-sample-000993 I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000994 EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM
cv-valid-train-sample-000995 IT WAS ENGINEERING AT ITS FINEST
cv-valid-train-sample-000996 ALL THINGS ARE ONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000997 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000998 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000999 HOW ABOUT ONCE MORE AROUND THE PARK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000000 LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000001 EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE EVOLVED HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000002 YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000003 SO NOW I FEAR NOTHING BECAUSE IT WAS THOSE OMENS THAT BROUGHT YOU TO ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000004 IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000005 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000006 NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000007 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000008 PUT JACKIE RIGHT ON THE STAFF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000009 WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000010 YOU MUST NOT LET UP EVEN AFTER HAVING COME SO FAR HE CONTINUED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000011 IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE WAR IS OVER THEN WAIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000012 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000013 BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE AND DIDN'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000014 AS THEY BEGAN TO DECORATE THE HALLWAY A SILHOUETTE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000015 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000016 HE WAS MY BROTHER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000017 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000018 WE'LL PAY ALL YOUR EXPENSES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000019 THEN THEY GOT AHOLD OF SOME DOUGH AND WENT GOOFY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000020 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000021 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000022 FILL THIS PLACE WITH A SANDSTORM SO STRONG THAT IT BLOTS OUT THE SUN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000023 I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000024 I MAKE MY LIVING FORECASTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000025 I DO WANT THAT PLATINUM RING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000026 TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT I HAD A RECURRENT DREAM TOO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000027 DON'T LET THEM SEE THAT YOU'RE AFRAID THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000028 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000029 THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFF AGAIN BUT WHEN I LOOKED OUTSIDE THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000030 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000031 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000032 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000033 THE YEARS OF RESEARCH THE MAGIC SYMBOLS THE STRANGE WORDS AND THE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000034 I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000035 THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000036 ASK THE OWNER OF THAT STALL HOW MUCH THE SWORD COSTS HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000037 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000038 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY GIVE UP ON IT SO EARLY TOO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000039 A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000040 THE SNOW BLASTED ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000041 HAVE A GOOD TRIP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000042 TRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU'RE IN THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000043 SEPARATION OF GARBAGE MAKES RECYCLING POSSIBLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000044 THEY WERE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT AND CLAMORED TO HEAR HIS STORIES ABOUT THE GREAT CITIES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000045 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000046 THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COMPANY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000047 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000048 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000049 SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000050 JUST THE ANT COLONY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000051 SO THE BOY WAS DISAPPOINTED HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN BELIEVE IN DREAMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000052 HOW DO YOU MEAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000053 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT GIRL'S VERY SICK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000054 THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000055 THE TRADITION TEACHES MEN HOW TO CROSS THE DESERT AND HOW THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD MARRY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000056 I'M EVERYTHING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID I WAS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000057 I'M IN A DRUGSTORE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000058 IT REQUIRED NO EXPLANATION JUST AS THE UNIVERSE NEEDS NONE AS IT TRAVELS THROUGH ENDLESS TIME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000059 FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000060 EVEN IF YOU CLEANED MY CRYSTAL FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000061 MR BRAD CABLES YOU NEED CASH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000062 WAIT FOR THE END OF THE WAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000063 HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000064 IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE THE LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000065 YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WITCH DOCTORS HE SPOKE SOME VERSES FROM THE KORAN AND MOVED ON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000066 THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000067 IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000068 THE FLOCK OF FLAMINGOS LANDED GRACEFULLY ON THEIR AWKWARD LOOKING LEGS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000069 THE BOY WAS SAD AS HE LEFT HER THAT DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000070 SHE WENT OVER TO THE HOSPITAL TO CALL ON PROFESSOR DAVIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000071 THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT HIS DESTINY TO THE END
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000072 THE CHARCOAL BURNED AWAY TO WHITE ASH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000073 THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000074 WHAT IF YOU CAN'T STAND HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000075 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000076 HE DIDN'T NEED TO DEMONSTRATE HIS SCIENCE AND ART TO ANYONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000077 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000078 BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOVE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000079 BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000080 WHY DO YOU WANT TO FIND THAT SORT OF PERSON THE ARAB ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000081 THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000082 HOW DO YOU HANDLE THE NEGATIVE WEIGHTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000083 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000084 AND ALSO BY UNHAPPINESS ENVY AND JEALOUSY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000085 TO CALIBRATE THE MOTION CAPTURING SYSTEM PLEASE DO A TPOSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000086 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000087 THE ALCHEMIST FOLLOWED AS THE BOY'S HORSE RAN FOR ALMOST HALF AN HOUR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000088 ALL THIS HAPPENED BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNSET THE BOY THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000089 SHALL I PUT A LITTLE RUM IN THE COFFEE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000090 TO NOURISH THE FALCON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000091 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000092 WHO IS THIS STRANGER WHO SPEAKS OF OMENS ASKED ONE OF THE CHIEFTAINS EYEING THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000093 HELP MY FRIEND MR RICHARD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000094 WANT TO WALK TO NEW YORK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000095 DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000096 I DIDN'T FALL IN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000097 IT'S LATE IN THE EVENING A PERFECT TIME FOR COFFEE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000098 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000099 THE BOSS SENT ME OVER WITH IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000100 HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000101 THE FUMES FROM THE TRAFFIC WAS UNBEARABLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000102 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000103 THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000104 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000105 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY APPARENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000106 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000107 THE ENGLISHMAN HAD SEVERAL SUITCASES FILLED WITH BOOKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000108 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000109 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000110 WISH I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000111 HE STILL CALLS HIS MOTHER MUMMY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000112 IT'S COMMON TO RUN INTO PROBLEMS SO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000113 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000114 THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000115 HARRY'LL TEAR HIS DINNER SUIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000116 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000117 YOU'VE GOT HIS GUN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000118 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000119 IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT IT MATTERS A LOT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000120 WE MUST BE GOOD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000121 WATCH OVER HER TONIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000122 DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000123 THERE'S A MOON OUT TONIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000124 THE BOY REPEATED HIS QUESTION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000125 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000126 YOU'RE A WEEK LATE FOR SCHOOL ALREADY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000127 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000128 YOU HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR DREAMS ABOUT THE OLD KING AND YOUR TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000129 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000130 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000131 THE LEVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000132 WITH THE GIRL WITH THE RAVEN HAIR HIS DAYS WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000133 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000134 WEAR THE BLUE ONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000135 LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOURLEAF CLOVERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000136 I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000137 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000138 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000139 THE TWO WALKED OUT AMONG THE PALMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000140 HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000141 THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000142 MEN HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS OF THE WISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000143 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000144 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000145 GET THE BULLETIN BOARD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000146 THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000147 YOU TOLD ME THAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000148 NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000149 DO YOU WANT TO WAKE THAT BABY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000150 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000151 I NEVER STOLE A WATCH IN MY LIFE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000152 GOOD LUCK TO YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000153 MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000154 I WAS JUST ASKING

sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000178 THEN LEAVE WITH THE CARAVAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000179 HE IS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND JUST TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWERS
