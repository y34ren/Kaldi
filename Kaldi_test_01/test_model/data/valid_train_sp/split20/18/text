sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000550 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000551 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000552 WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000553 HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000554 DOESNT IT DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF HASHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000555 AND THAT HE A BOY COULD PERFORM MIRACLES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000556 IT WON'T HURT YOU AND WE CAN MAKE THE CITY EDITION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000557 THE NAVY'S GOING TO FLY FATHER HOME THIS AFTERNOON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000558 HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000559 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000560 WE ATE SPICY RICE WITH CHICKEN LEGS AND WHITE MUSHROOMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000561 THE HEAT LASTED UNTIL NIGHTFALL AND ALL THAT TIME HE HAD TO CARRY HIS JACKET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000562 AND I'LL SIGN A PAPER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000563 THAT'S AN INHERENT DISADVANTAGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000564 I'D BETTER HUSTLE HIM UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000565 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000566 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000567 I'M AFRAID SHE'D FEEL ASHAMED TO THINK SHE HADN'T TRUSTED YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000568 BUT I'M GOING TO EGYPT THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000569 WHAT WERE YOU WHEN YOU CAME HERE FIVE YEARS AGO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000570 I GOT IT BACK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000571 I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000572 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000573 FASTFOOD IS CONVENIENT BUT OFTEN UNHEALTHY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000574 HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE MORNING'S MEETING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000575 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000576 THE NEARBY CITY OF CEUTA HAD GROWN FASTER THAN TANGIER AND BUSINESS HAD FALLEN OFF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000577 HE'S DEPOSITED TEN DOLLARS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000578 ONLY US EXPLORERS CAN GET IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000579 JUST A MEMORY RIGHT NOW IT SIGNIFIED SHADE WATER AND A REFUGE FROM THE WAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000580 THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000581 DIDN'T I TELL YOU NEVER TO COME PANHANDLING AROUND HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000582 THIS WILL HELP YOU EFFECTIVELY COLLABORATE WITH DEVELOPERS AND COORDINATE CROSSTEAM PROJECTS THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000583 BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000584 BUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT HAD NO CHOICE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000585 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000586 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000587 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000588 THE MAN WEPT WITH HAPPINESS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000589 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000590 COME IN AGAIN SOME TIME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000591 RAISINS ARE DELICIOUS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000592 HE WANTED YOUR MONEY HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000593 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000594 MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000595 YOU MUSTN'T LET WHAT SHE SAID BOTHER YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000596 SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME THE SUN ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000597 HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU GET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000598 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000599 HOW DO I GUESS AT THE FUTURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000600 LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000601 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000602 DON'T MIND THE COLONEL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000603 HE THOUGHT OF ALL THE MARRIED SHEPHERDS HE HAD KNOWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000604 I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000605 AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000606 WHAT IS A FOREIGNER DOING HERE ASKED ANOTHER OF THE MEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000607 AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000608 THERE'S THAT REPRIEVE IF THEY EVER FIND OUT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000609 THREE DAYS FROM NOW HE WOULD BE WITH THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000610 IF YOU DON'T STOP FOLLOWING ME I'LL CALL THE POLICE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000611 BUT MAYBE PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT WAY HAD NEVER LEARNED THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000612 BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000613 LOOKS LIKE ABOUT TEN YEARS A PIECE FOR YOU BIRDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000614 HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000615 THE OTHER SON WAS A POET AND DELIGHTED ALL OF ROME WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL VERSES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000616 HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000617 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000618 ONE MUST PREPARE FOR IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000619 BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUMNI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000620 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000621 IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000622 A MAN DOESN'T GET IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS EVERY DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000623 CAN I GET A WOOT WOOT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000624 I THINK IT'S ABOUT BIRD HUNTING BUT NOW I CAN SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000625 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000626 SUNBURNS CAN BE AVOIDED BY APPLYING SUNSCREEN OR BY STAYING IN THE SHADOWS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000627 IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000628 IF HE EVER DECIDED TO LEAVE THEM THEY WOULD SUFFER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000629 TAKE CHARGE OF HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000630 I LOST MY WALLET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000631 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000632 HE'S NUTS ABOUT YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000633 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000634 I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRANSMITTED BY WORD OF MOUTH HE THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000635 IT'S THE OTHER FOREIGNER THE ENGLISHMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000636 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000637 THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOSED OFF THE CONVERSATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000638 YOU'LL NEVER GET IT OUT OF ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000639 IT WAS THE PURE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000640 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000641 I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000642 I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CHANGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000643 IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000644 THEY WENT TO THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE MONASTERY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000645 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000646 IF WHAT ONE FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTER IT WILL NEVER SPOIL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000647 WILL I LEARN TO DO THAT SOMEDAY THE BOY ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000648 THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000649 HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000650 BY THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION I SAW THEM STAGGERING AND FALLING AND THEIR SUPPORTERS TURNING TO RUN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000651 AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000652 IT HAD TOLD HIM TO DIG WHERE HIS TEARS FELL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000653 HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000654 MOHAMMED IS A WONDERFUL GUITAR PLAYER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000655 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000656 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000657 A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000658 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000659 LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000660 THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000661 AND HE KNEW WHAT WAS THE FAIR PRICE FOR EVERY ONE OF HIS ANIMALS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000662 MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000663 MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000664 THEY'RE CALLING TO US NOT TO GIVE UP AND TO KEEP ON FIGHTING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000665 IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000666 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000667 OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000668 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000669 I'M GOING TO THEM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000670 I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000671 SUNBURNS CAN BE AVOIDED BY APPLYING SUNSCREEN OR BY STAYING IN THE SHADOWS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000672 THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000673 AND THE LAST ONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000674 A LOT OF MONEY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000675 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000676 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000677 I SAID I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000678 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000679 I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000680 ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE EVERY LIE HE TELLS YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000681 THERE WAS A HOLE THERE AMONG THE STONES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000682 LICORICE IS A BLACK CHEWY FOOD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000683 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000684 THE SHEEP FIDGETED NEARBY UNEASY WITH THEIR NEW OWNER AND EXCITED BY SO MUCH CHANGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000685 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000686 HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000687 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000688 THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000689 I DIDN'T COME HERE TO HAVE YOU READ MY PALM HE SAID ALREADY REGRETTING HAVING COME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000690 I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT MY HORIZON HAS EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000691 IT SORT OF MAKES A FELLOW LOSE FAITH IN HIMSELF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000692 THOSE GYPSIES ARE REALLY SMART HE THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000693 DO I LOOK AS FUNNY AS YOU DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000694 BUT I'M LIABLE TO GET INTO A JAM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000695 ALL THE VILLAGERS CHEERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000696 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000697 THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000698 THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000699 YOU BROUGHT A NEW FEELING INTO MY CRYSTAL SHOP
