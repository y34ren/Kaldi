sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000950 THE OLD MAN LEAFED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000951 I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000952 AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000953 THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000954 RELAXED AND UNHURRIED HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD WALK THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF TANGIER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000955 THE MEETING WAS OVER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000956 ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000957 THAT WASN'T AT ALL NECESSARY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000958 I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000959 WHEN HE EMERGED IT WAS WITH A YOUNG ARAB DRESSED IN WHITE AND GOLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000960 WERE THEY QUICK OR WERE THEY ENRAGED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000961 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000962 AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000963 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE IN HIS HEART THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO DO SO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000964 THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000965 BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TWICE WILL SURELY HAPPEN A THIRD TIME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000966 AND THIS IS WHAT YOUR SON SAID THE ANGEL TOLD THE MAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000967 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000968 WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000969 IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000970 HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000971 YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000972 IF IT WOULD SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000973 HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000974 THEY WERE ALL FURIOUS WHEN THE ESCAPADE FAILED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000975 IT ALWAYS HELPS TO BE LEARNING SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000976 WHERE ARE YOU BOUND ASKED THE YOUNG ARAB
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000977 AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000978 I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000979 I'M NOT AFRAID OF FAILING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000980 SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000981 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000982 ANY DOPE YET ON HOW HE GOT OUT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000983 THEY'RE NOT FOR SALE HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000984 THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000985 MIND IF I SIT DOWN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000986 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000987 HE HAD STUDIED LATIN SPANISH AND THEOLOGY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000988 MR BEAN IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF A BRITISH COMEDY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000989 THE IDEAS SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN A MORE CONCISE AND DIRECT MANNER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000990 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000991 I'M GOING TO CHECK UP ON THAT RIGHT AWAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000992 BUTMAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000993 I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000994 EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000995 IT WAS ENGINEERING AT ITS FINEST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000996 ALL THINGS ARE ONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000997 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000998 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000999 HOW ABOUT ONCE MORE AROUND THE PARK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000000 LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000001 EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE EVOLVED HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000002 YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000003 SO NOW I FEAR NOTHING BECAUSE IT WAS THOSE OMENS THAT BROUGHT YOU TO ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000004 IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000005 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000006 NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000007 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000008 PUT JACKIE RIGHT ON THE STAFF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000009 WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000010 YOU MUST NOT LET UP EVEN AFTER HAVING COME SO FAR HE CONTINUED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000011 IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE WAR IS OVER THEN WAIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000012 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000013 BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE AND DIDN'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000014 AS THEY BEGAN TO DECORATE THE HALLWAY A SILHOUETTE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000015 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000016 HE WAS MY BROTHER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000017 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000018 WE'LL PAY ALL YOUR EXPENSES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000019 THEN THEY GOT AHOLD OF SOME DOUGH AND WENT GOOFY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000020 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000021 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000022 FILL THIS PLACE WITH A SANDSTORM SO STRONG THAT IT BLOTS OUT THE SUN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000023 I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000024 I MAKE MY LIVING FORECASTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000025 I DO WANT THAT PLATINUM RING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000026 TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT I HAD A RECURRENT DREAM TOO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000027 DON'T LET THEM SEE THAT YOU'RE AFRAID THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000028 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000029 THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFF AGAIN BUT WHEN I LOOKED OUTSIDE THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000030 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000031 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000032 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000033 THE YEARS OF RESEARCH THE MAGIC SYMBOLS THE STRANGE WORDS AND THE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000034 I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000035 THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000036 ASK THE OWNER OF THAT STALL HOW MUCH THE SWORD COSTS HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000037 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000038 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY GIVE UP ON IT SO EARLY TOO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000039 A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000040 THE SNOW BLASTED ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000041 HAVE A GOOD TRIP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000042 TRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU'RE IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000043 SEPARATION OF GARBAGE MAKES RECYCLING POSSIBLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000044 THEY WERE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT AND CLAMORED TO HEAR HIS STORIES ABOUT THE GREAT CITIES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000045 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000046 THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COMPANY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000047 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000048 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000049 SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000050 JUST THE ANT COLONY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000051 SO THE BOY WAS DISAPPOINTED HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN BELIEVE IN DREAMS

sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000065 YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WITCH DOCTORS HE SPOKE SOME VERSES FROM THE KORAN AND MOVED ON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000066 THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000067 IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000068 THE FLOCK OF FLAMINGOS LANDED GRACEFULLY ON THEIR AWKWARD LOOKING LEGS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000069 THE BOY WAS SAD AS HE LEFT HER THAT DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000070 SHE WENT OVER TO THE HOSPITAL TO CALL ON PROFESSOR DAVIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000071 THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT HIS DESTINY TO THE END
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000072 THE CHARCOAL BURNED AWAY TO WHITE ASH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000073 THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000074 WHAT IF YOU CAN'T STAND HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000075 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000076 HE DIDN'T NEED TO DEMONSTRATE HIS SCIENCE AND ART TO ANYONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000077 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
