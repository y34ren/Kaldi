cv-valid-dev-sample-000000 BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
cv-valid-dev-sample-000001 THEN WHY SHOULD THEY BE SURPRISED WHEN THEY SEE ONE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000002 A YOUNG ARAB ALSO LOADED DOWN WITH BAGGAGE ENTERED AND GREETED THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-dev-sample-000003 I THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING I OWNED WOULD BE DESTROYED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000004 HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
cv-valid-dev-sample-000005 BUT EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000006 ARE YOU SURE THIS IS CLAIRE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000007 IT HAD TOLD HIM TO DIG WHERE HIS TEARS FELL
cv-valid-dev-sample-000008 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000009 THE TEACHER THOUGHT THAT HE'D TAUGHT HIMSELF ALL HE COULD
cv-valid-dev-sample-000010 THE BOY STEPPED CLOSER TO THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SMILED HE DID THE SAME
cv-valid-dev-sample-000011 YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET
cv-valid-dev-sample-000012 BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000013 IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
cv-valid-dev-sample-000014 WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000015 GOT ANYTHING NEW ON THE HANGING
cv-valid-dev-sample-000016 IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT ME TO TELL VINCENT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000017 ONE OF US IS GOING TO JAIL
cv-valid-dev-sample-000018 TO NOURISH THE FALCON
cv-valid-dev-sample-000019 THIS CONVENTION'S GONNA COST PLENTY
cv-valid-dev-sample-000020 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
cv-valid-dev-sample-000021 NEXT INSTALL AN EXTENSION THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ADD CUSTOM PYTHON COMMANDS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000022 THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-dev-sample-000023 IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
cv-valid-dev-sample-000024 SO YOU WON'T BLAME HER
cv-valid-dev-sample-000025 BUT THAT'S WHY YOU CREATED THE GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000026 DON'T SAY THAT AGAIN
cv-valid-dev-sample-000027 HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
cv-valid-dev-sample-000028 IT TURNED OUT TO BE A BITTER TEA
cv-valid-dev-sample-000029 ARE YOU GONNA THROW A ROCK
cv-valid-dev-sample-000030 AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
cv-valid-dev-sample-000031 MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000032 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
cv-valid-dev-sample-000033 I WAS JUST IN TOWN EARLIER THIS YEAR SO IT IS KIND OF CRAZY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE RIGHT AFTER
cv-valid-dev-sample-000034 I WANT TO SEE THAT MAP COVERED BEFORE WE GET THROUGH
cv-valid-dev-sample-000035 IT MADE ME VERY DEPRESSED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000036 ITS IMPORTANT TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND SHE HAS URGED ME TO DO THE SAME
cv-valid-dev-sample-000037 MINE'S IN THE DOOR
cv-valid-dev-sample-000038 FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE YOU CAN SEE THE CONCENTRIC CIRCLES
cv-valid-dev-sample-000039 HE MUST BE DISGUISED TO AVOID ENCOUNTERS WITH THIEVES
cv-valid-dev-sample-000040 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
cv-valid-dev-sample-000041 I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO
cv-valid-dev-sample-000042 HIS SPEECH ENDED IN STANDING OVATIONS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000043 IN A WAY SO AM I HE SAID
cv-valid-dev-sample-000044 WHEN THE SUN SETS THE MEN WILL ONCE AGAIN SURRENDER THEIR ARMS TO ME
cv-valid-dev-sample-000045 I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000046 WE MUST BE GOOD
cv-valid-dev-sample-000047 HE ALMOST BEGAN TO TELL ABOUT HIS TREASURE BUT DECIDED NOT TO DO SO
cv-valid-dev-sample-000048 NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
cv-valid-dev-sample-000049 WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
cv-valid-dev-sample-000050 THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
cv-valid-dev-sample-000051 OUR GENERATOR HAS BEEN DISRUPTED BY ULTRA HIGH FREQUENCY WAVES
cv-valid-dev-sample-000052 HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
cv-valid-dev-sample-000053 ALMOST EVERYONE HERE SPEAKS SPANISH
cv-valid-dev-sample-000054 THE REPORT WAS LARGELY SCATHING
cv-valid-dev-sample-000055 NO ONE ATTACKS AN OASIS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000056 WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000057 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
cv-valid-dev-sample-000058 IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
cv-valid-dev-sample-000059 THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000060 EXCUSE YOU FOR WHAT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000061 YESTERDAY I WAITED FOREVER FOR THE SUBWAY TRAIN
cv-valid-dev-sample-000062 I'LL GO RIGHT AFTER IT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000063 JUST MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME
cv-valid-dev-sample-000064 AND YOU'VE TOLD ME ABOUT OMENS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000065 WHERE WAS HIS HORSE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000066 IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND
cv-valid-dev-sample-000067 COMPILING THE LINUX KERNEL CAN BE TIME CONSUMING
cv-valid-dev-sample-000068 IF THAT GUY LAYS AN EGG
cv-valid-dev-sample-000069 THE BRASS LAMP HAD BEEN DISTURBED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000070 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
cv-valid-dev-sample-000071 WHO DO YOU THINK WRITES THEM
cv-valid-dev-sample-000072 I'M OK IF YOU'RE OK ABOUT IT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000073 THE ACHIEVED RESULTS ARE FAR BEHIND THE STATEOFTHEART IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
cv-valid-dev-sample-000074 I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000075 JUDGE DEBRA SENT ME
cv-valid-dev-sample-000076 A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000077 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000078 THE HOMELESS SEEM TO LIKE SOUP
cv-valid-dev-sample-000079 AND FINALLY THE FALCON RETURNED WITH THEIR MEAL
cv-valid-dev-sample-000080 TWO MORE MONTHS PASSED AND THE SHELF BROUGHT MANY CUSTOMERS INTO THE CRYSTAL SHOP
cv-valid-dev-sample-000081 HE DECANTED THE WINE AND BEGAN TO RECOUNT THE DISTURBING STORY HE HAD BEEN TOLD
cv-valid-dev-sample-000082 AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000083 LOOK AT THE POLICY I GAVE HIM
cv-valid-dev-sample-000084 THEN I DON'T GET PAID
cv-valid-dev-sample-000085 I GOT TWO GIANT BUG BITES ON MY RIGHT LEG FROM LAST NIGHT AND THEY HURT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000086 BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
cv-valid-dev-sample-000087 AND ALSO BY UNHAPPINESS ENVY AND JEALOUSY
cv-valid-dev-sample-000088 SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000089 THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER
cv-valid-dev-sample-000090 I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CHARGE THEM WITH
cv-valid-dev-sample-000091 WHAT WAS ALL THAT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000092 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD DONE THAT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000093 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-dev-sample-000094 WE CAN'T LET THE CHRONICLE GET THE LAUGH ON US
cv-valid-dev-sample-000095 YOU'RE FAR TOO VALUABLE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000096 THEY EAT LUNCH TOGETHER OFTEN BUT DONT REALLY TALK OUTSIDE THE OFFICE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000097 A HALF A HEELOT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000098 HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
cv-valid-dev-sample-000099 IT IS RECOMMENDED TO DRINK AT LEAST TWO LITERS OF WATER A DAY
cv-valid-dev-sample-000100 VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THROUGHOUT THE TENT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000101 THOMAS WENT TO WAR
cv-valid-dev-sample-000102 THEY WERE IN AN IMMENSE SETTING SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SPEAKING A STRANGE LANGUAGE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000103 TANGIER IS NOT LIKE THE REST OF AFRICA
cv-valid-dev-sample-000104 I'LL HANG IT UP
cv-valid-dev-sample-000105 THERE IS A WAY OUT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000106 I'M GOING WITH YOU THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-dev-sample-000107 WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000108 I'LL TELL YOU IN A MINUTE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000109 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000110 IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
cv-valid-dev-sample-000111 THAT'S WHY I WAS SENT DOWN HERE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000112 I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000113 HE HAD COME TO THE TOWN ONLY TO FIND A WOMAN WHO COULD INTERPRET HIS DREAM
cv-valid-dev-sample-000114 WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
cv-valid-dev-sample-000115 FOR SOME REASON WE WERE BLOCKED FROM ENTERING
cv-valid-dev-sample-000116 THE SWIMMING POOL WAS FULL OF CHLORINE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000117 BUT YOU ARE IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000118 HE WAS MORE CONFIDENT IN HIMSELF THOUGH AND FELT AS THOUGH HE COULD CONQUER THE WORLD
cv-valid-dev-sample-000119 SHE REFILLED HER VESSEL AND LEFT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000120 I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000121 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WE WILL BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR OUR ENEMIES
cv-valid-dev-sample-000122 AT OTHER TIMES AT A CRUCIAL MOMENT I MAKE IT EASIER FOR THINGS TO HAPPEN
cv-valid-dev-sample-000123 ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000124 YOU CAN'T DESERT NOW
cv-valid-dev-sample-000125 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-dev-sample-000126 YOU HAVE BEEN STOPPING ME
cv-valid-dev-sample-000127 THERE WERE RAISED VOICESAND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON 
cv-valid-dev-sample-000128 I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
cv-valid-dev-sample-000129 HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000130 USING SCRIPT BLOCKERS IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA BUT IT REQUIRES THE USER TO LEARN A BIT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000131 SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
cv-valid-dev-sample-000132 HE'S HOME COOKING DINNER
cv-valid-dev-sample-000133 LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE STANDARD DEVIATION
cv-valid-dev-sample-000134 NOW THAT'S TOO MUCH
cv-valid-dev-sample-000135 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
cv-valid-dev-sample-000136 THE CEILING COLLAPSED INWARDS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000137 FOR EXAMPLE I CAN SAY SCORE TEST WORD TO PRINT TEST WORD OR CAMEL TEST WORD TO PRINT TESTWORD
cv-valid-dev-sample-000138 I'M A WOMAN OF THE DESERT SHE SAID AVERTING HER FACE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000139 WE WANT TO SELL HANDMADE CHUKKA BOOTS IN THAT FOOD TRUCK
cv-valid-dev-sample-000140 HE'S TALKING LIKE A CHILD
cv-valid-dev-sample-000141 THE QUICKER THE BETTER
cv-valid-dev-sample-000142 AND YOU MARRIED HER
cv-valid-dev-sample-000143 FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
cv-valid-dev-sample-000144 THE ENGLISHMAN'S EYES LIT UP
cv-valid-dev-sample-000145 FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
cv-valid-dev-sample-000146 WHEN THE SUN SETS THE MEN WILL ONCE AGAIN SURRENDER THEIR ARMS TO ME
cv-valid-dev-sample-000147 ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000148 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
cv-valid-dev-sample-000149 NOW LEAVE US ALONE SAID THE BOY TO THE YOUNG ARAB
cv-valid-dev-sample-000150 ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000151 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
cv-valid-dev-sample-000152 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000153 A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000154 I'M HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000155 IT'S NOT WHAT ENTERS MEN'S MOUTHS THAT'S EVIL SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-dev-sample-000156 AN ARMY IS COMING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-dev-sample-000157 SO YOU KNOW ABOUT LOVE THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-dev-sample-000158 THERE ARE RUMORS OF TRIBAL WARS HE TOLD THEM
cv-valid-dev-sample-000159 THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000160 THE STEEL OF ITS BLADE GLITTERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
cv-valid-dev-sample-000161 THE MAN LOOKED AT THE ANGEL IN SURPRISE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000162 HE ONLY LOST THREE BUTTONS OFF HIS VEST
cv-valid-dev-sample-000163 I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER AFTER THE BOAT SAILS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000164 THE ENGLISHMAN DIDN'T ANSWER HIM DIRECTLY
cv-valid-dev-sample-000165 HE FELT WEIGHTED DOWN BY THE CENTURIES OF TIME SINCE THE PYRAMIDS HAD BEEN BUILT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000166 FATIMA THE GIRL SAID AVERTING HER EYES
cv-valid-dev-sample-000167 THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000168 IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'VE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000169 I'M NOT RUBBING IT IN
cv-valid-dev-sample-000170 NOW LET'S SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU PROTEST
cv-valid-dev-sample-000171 FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
cv-valid-dev-sample-000172 ON THE VERY FIRST PAGE IT DESCRIBED A BURIAL CEREMONY
cv-valid-dev-sample-000173 YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY MY FATHER WAS NO BUSINESS MAN
cv-valid-dev-sample-000174 THE WOMAN SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A PERSON AND HURRIED AWAY
cv-valid-dev-sample-000175 WHAT BOAT YOU SAILING ON
cv-valid-dev-sample-000176 HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
cv-valid-dev-sample-000177 WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ELEANOR
cv-valid-dev-sample-000178 IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
cv-valid-dev-sample-000179 WORKED HARD JUST TO HAVE FOOD AND WATER LIKE THE SHEEP
cv-valid-dev-sample-000180 WHAT A LOAD OF TRASH SARAH OPINED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000181 REST WELL TONIGHT AS IF YOU WERE A WARRIOR PREPARING FOR COMBAT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000182 THE TEENAGERS PUT ON RED HOODIES FOR THEIR ANNUAL TOBOGGAN RUN
cv-valid-dev-sample-000183 LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
cv-valid-dev-sample-000184 BERLIN CAN BE SO LOVELY THIS TIME OF YEAR
cv-valid-dev-sample-000185 LAURA TOOK OUT A CIGARETTE AND PLACED IT IN HER MOUTH
cv-valid-dev-sample-000186 THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT HIS DESTINY TO THE END
cv-valid-dev-sample-000187 THE VISION VANISHED IMMEDIATELY BUT IT HAD SHAKEN HIM
cv-valid-dev-sample-000188 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000189 CROOKS DON'T PAY TAXES
cv-valid-dev-sample-000190 THE OMENS HAD TOLD HIM SO
cv-valid-dev-sample-000191 BUT THE BOY KNEW THAT HE WAS REFERRING TO FATIMA
cv-valid-dev-sample-000192 THE ARAB ACCEPTED THEM WITHOUT A WORD
cv-valid-dev-sample-000193 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-dev-sample-000194 WELCOME TO DAVE'S GUITAR SESSION
cv-valid-dev-sample-000195 IS THAT JOB STILL OPEN
cv-valid-dev-sample-000196 WHEN HE WAS A CHILD THAT MAN WANTED TO TRAVEL TOO
cv-valid-dev-sample-000197 HE BELIEVED IN OMENS
cv-valid-dev-sample-000198 ON TOP OF ALL THAT THE WEEDS KEEP GROWING AND THE GARBAGE HAS TO BE TAKEN OUT
cv-valid-dev-sample-000199 BUT A LOVELY CHAP
