cv-valid-train-sample-000064 IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE THE LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000066 THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
cv-valid-train-sample-000069 THE BOY WAS SAD AS HE LEFT HER THAT DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000070 SHE WENT OVER TO THE HOSPITAL TO CALL ON PROFESSOR DAVIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000072 THE CHARCOAL BURNED AWAY TO WHITE ASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000074 WHAT IF YOU CAN'T STAND HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000078 BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOVE

cv-valid-train-sample-000098 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000101 THE FUMES FROM THE TRAFFIC WAS UNBEARABLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000104 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000105 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY APPARENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000109 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000110 WISH I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000111 HE STILL CALLS HIS MOTHER MUMMY

cv-valid-train-sample-000124 THE BOY REPEATED HIS QUESTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000129 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
cv-valid-train-sample-000131 THE LEVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
cv-valid-train-sample-000134 WEAR THE BLUE ONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000136 I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000138 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000139 THE TWO WALKED OUT AMONG THE PALMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000140 HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000142 MEN HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS OF THE WISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000145 GET THE BULLETIN BOARD
cv-valid-train-sample-000146 THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000147 YOU TOLD ME THAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000149 DO YOU WANT TO WAKE THAT BABY
cv-valid-train-sample-000151 I NEVER STOLE A WATCH IN MY LIFE
cv-valid-train-sample-000152 GOOD LUCK TO YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000153 MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000154 I WAS JUST ASKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000155 LET HIM HAVE EVERYTHING HE WANTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000158 EGYPT IS A COUNTRY THAT IS OFTEN MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000159 HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
cv-valid-train-sample-000161 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000162 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000166 WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
cv-valid-train-sample-000168 THE ALARM CLOCK WAS SET FOR TWENTY PAST THREE
cv-valid-train-sample-000173 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000175 GET SOME WATER QUICKLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000178 THEN LEAVE WITH THE CARAVAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000181 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000182 THERE ISN'T ANY MORE WINE
cv-valid-train-sample-000183 DOES THIS BELONG TO YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000184 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000185 THEY WANTED TO SAVE THE OASIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000186 TWO HORSEMEN WAITING AHEAD OF THEM
cv-valid-train-sample-000187 I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000188 I DON'T MUCH LIKE CHANGE HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000191 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000192 HE'S IN MY ROOM
cv-valid-train-sample-000193 IS SHE AS GOOD AS YOU SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000194 THEY FILLED THREE SACKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000195 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000196 THIS IS THE MORNING POST YOU'RE TALKING TO
cv-valid-train-sample-000198 THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000199 IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
cv-valid-train-sample-000200 THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000203 I KNOW ITS DIMENSIONS AND HOW IT BEHAVES
cv-valid-train-sample-000204 OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT
cv-valid-train-sample-000205 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000206 TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000207 GET DOWN QUICK
cv-valid-train-sample-000210 YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
cv-valid-train-sample-000211 IT WAS HARASSMENT PURE AND SIMPLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000213 HOW WAS THAT FOR A TIGHT SQUEEZE
cv-valid-train-sample-000215 WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000216 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000217 GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SEASON
cv-valid-train-sample-000218 THE DISPLAY WAS UNDERWHELMING
cv-valid-train-sample-000219 NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FELLOWS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
cv-valid-train-sample-000222 I'M GONNA BUILD AIR FIELDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000223 HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000224 A POX UPON ME FOR A CLUMSY THING
cv-valid-train-sample-000225 STOVE'S HOTTER THAN I THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000227 THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF
cv-valid-train-sample-000229 YOU THINK IT'S EASY
cv-valid-train-sample-000232 THE WIRELESS JOYPAD WAS EXPERIENCING CONNECTION ISSUES
cv-valid-train-sample-000235 IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000236 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000237 THAT'S WHY ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE NICE
cv-valid-train-sample-000238 THIS IS A TRICK TO GET YOUR SYMPATHY
cv-valid-train-sample-000242 TONIGHT THEY WOULD FIND OUT THE TRUTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000244 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000246 HE HAD ASSUMED HE WOULD SOON RETURN TO HIS SHEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000248 NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000250 HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000251 I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000254 IT ALL HAPPENED RATHER SUDDENLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000255 SURE SEE YOU THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000256 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train-sample-000260 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
cv-valid-train-sample-000262 THIS IS JON DAVIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000263 THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000267 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
cv-valid-train-sample-000273 I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
cv-valid-train-sample-000274 I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000277 THERE IS A REPTILE IN MY WESTERN SHOES
cv-valid-train-sample-000279 I WANT TO STAY AT THE OASIS THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000280 AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
cv-valid-train-sample-000281 WHAT'S IN THAT DESK
cv-valid-train-sample-000284 THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000287 EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000288 BECAUSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WOULD FIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000290 THE BOY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000293 WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000294 THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000295 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
cv-valid-train-sample-000303 I DON'T KNOW YOU FROM ADAM
cv-valid-train-sample-000304 THEY WERE RACING DOWN THE STREETS WITH NO REGARD FOR ANYONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000305 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000307 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
cv-valid-train-sample-000308 THERESA COULDN'T FEEL ANY MORE DUMB RIGHT NOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000309 HE'S ALLERGIC TO HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000315 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000317 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000320 WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO WRITE ABOUT HILLARY
cv-valid-train-sample-000321 HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000322 JOHNATHAN ASSESSED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000323 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
cv-valid-train-sample-000325 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000326 HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THE STRANGE LAND HE WAS IN
cv-valid-train-sample-000328 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
cv-valid-train-sample-000330 IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
cv-valid-train-sample-000334 SO IMMERSE YOURSELF IN IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000335 WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000337 HIS NAME IS WELCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000338 THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000342 THE MAN LOOKED AT THE ANGEL IN SURPRISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000343 BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000344 THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MORE TEA
cv-valid-train-sample-000345 THAT WAS HIS WORK
cv-valid-train-sample-000346 WHAT YOUR HUSBAND WAS MIXED UP IN
cv-valid-train-sample-000350 THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000351 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000352 IT'S THE ONLY ONE THEY HAD LEFT
cv-valid-train-sample-000353 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000356 THERE WAS NO OTHER BAGGAGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000357 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
cv-valid-train-sample-000358 DID YOU SAY A KING HE ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000359 WHAT HE SAID REMINDED THE BOY OF THE OLD KING
cv-valid-train-sample-000366 IT'S THE ONLY NAME I'VE GOT
cv-valid-train-sample-000369 I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS
cv-valid-train-sample-000370 IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE
cv-valid-train-sample-000371 THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000372 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000375 MY KEYCHAIN IS HEAVY AND AWKWARD TO CARRY IN MY POCKET
cv-valid-train-sample-000376 I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000378 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000379 I KNOW THAT GIRL
cv-valid-train-sample-000380 HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000381 BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000383 LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
cv-valid-train-sample-000387 HOW COULD HE BE A FAKE
cv-valid-train-sample-000391 I FEEL LIKE A BOOTLEGGER
cv-valid-train-sample-000393 THEN GET OUT OF HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000394 THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
cv-valid-train-sample-000395 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000398 YOU ALL KNOW ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000400 I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THAT TUB
cv-valid-train-sample-000403 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000406 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
cv-valid-train-sample-000408 THAT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000410 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
cv-valid-train-sample-000411 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
cv-valid-train-sample-000413 SHE JOINED UP TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000414 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000418 I'M GOING TO THEM
cv-valid-train-sample-000420 IT BELONGS TO ME NOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000421 HAS HE BEEN HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000423 YOU SAID YOU WANTED FIREWORKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000426 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train-sample-000427 I WISH THEY WERE TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000428 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
cv-valid-train-sample-000431 DONT FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE IT WOULD NOT HELP
cv-valid-train-sample-000432 THERE WAS A SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE STATUE
cv-valid-train-sample-000433 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000434 HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000435 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000437 NOBODY'S TRYING TO STEAL FROM YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000439 IT CONSIDERS THE HORIZONTAL DIMENSION AS TIME
cv-valid-train-sample-000447 THAT HE HAD ATTENDED A SEMINARY UNTIL HE WAS SIXTEEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000449 KEEP HIM IN HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000450 MAYBE TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER THAN YESTERDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000451 SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALEX PRETTY WELL
cv-valid-train-sample-000453 WHEN THE SIMUM CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000454 THE FOREST BURNED FOR THIRTEEN DAYS
cv-valid-train-sample-000457 HE WASHED THE DETRITUS FROM HIS HAIR
cv-valid-train-sample-000458 THAT'S WHAT ALCHEMISTS DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000460 THE RESTAURANT WAS QUITE EXPENSIVE
cv-valid-train-sample-000461 PHONE THE NEWSPAPERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000467 I DIDN'T FRISK HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000470 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
cv-valid-train-sample-000472 I'M LEAVING TODAY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000473 THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000475 AND TOMORROW HIS ENEMY WOULD ALSO BE A PART OF THAT SOUL
cv-valid-train-sample-000476 I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000477 SO THEN TRY HE SAID TO THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000478 I DON'T BELIEVE IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000479 THE VIRUS SPREAD FASTER THAN WILDFIRE
cv-valid-train-sample-000482 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000483 PERHAPS SHE MET SOMEBODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000484 TAKE YOUR PAWS OFF ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000485 APPLE PIE IS AN ICONIC DISH
cv-valid-train-sample-000486 AM I GOING TO FIND MY TREASURE HE ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000488 THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
cv-valid-train-sample-000489 COACH HAS HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000490 THE SUN WAS TURNED INTO A GOLDEN DISK
cv-valid-train-sample-000491 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000493 AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000496 WHAT DO YOU SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000499 SURE I KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES
cv-valid-train-sample-000500 HE'S THE MAN THE ADS ARE WRITTEN FOR
cv-valid-train-sample-000502 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000504 WE WANT SOME ACTION IN THESE PICTURES
cv-valid-train-sample-000505 SYMBOLS OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000506 THIS GUY STOLE MY WATCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000507 IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WINE HE HAD EVER TASTED
cv-valid-train-sample-000508 IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000509 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
cv-valid-train-sample-000511 DO YOU MIND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE CROWDED
cv-valid-train-sample-000513 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
cv-valid-train-sample-000514 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000515 HE'S THE ONLY HUSBAND I'VE GOT
cv-valid-train-sample-000516 THIS IS FOR YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000517 THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000518 HE NEVER ASKED ME TO SIT DOWN IN HIS LIFE
cv-valid-train-sample-000519 MY NAME'S PETE DAVIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000520 PRETTY NICE NECK YOU'VE GOT THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000522 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN

cv-valid-train-sample-000538 YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000539 YOUR HEART IS ALIVE
cv-valid-train-sample-000543 I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000544 I'D HATE TO HAVE THAT MANY PINS STUCK IN ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000545 BUT WHAT'S ALL THIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000550 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000552 WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000554 DOESNT IT DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF HASHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000556 IT WON'T HURT YOU AND WE CAN MAKE THE CITY EDITION
cv-valid-train-sample-000558 HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000562 AND I'LL SIGN A PAPER
cv-valid-train-sample-000563 THAT'S AN INHERENT DISADVANTAGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000564 I'D BETTER HUSTLE HIM UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000566 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
cv-valid-train-sample-000568 BUT I'M GOING TO EGYPT THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000570 I GOT IT BACK
cv-valid-train-sample-000573 FASTFOOD IS CONVENIENT BUT OFTEN UNHEALTHY
cv-valid-train-sample-000574 HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE MORNING'S MEETING
cv-valid-train-sample-000577 HE'S DEPOSITED TEN DOLLARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000578 ONLY US EXPLORERS CAN GET IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000581 DIDN'T I TELL YOU NEVER TO COME PANHANDLING AROUND HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000584 BUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT HAD NO CHOICE
cv-valid-train-sample-000587 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000588 THE MAN WEPT WITH HAPPINESS
cv-valid-train-sample-000590 COME IN AGAIN SOME TIME
cv-valid-train-sample-000591 RAISINS ARE DELICIOUS
cv-valid-train-sample-000592 HE WANTED YOUR MONEY HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000594 MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000595 YOU MUSTN'T LET WHAT SHE SAID BOTHER YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000597 HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU GET
cv-valid-train-sample-000599 HOW DO I GUESS AT THE FUTURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000600 LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
cv-valid-train-sample-000602 DON'T MIND THE COLONEL
cv-valid-train-sample-000607 AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000608 THERE'S THAT REPRIEVE IF THEY EVER FIND OUT
cv-valid-train-sample-000610 IF YOU DON'T STOP FOLLOWING ME I'LL CALL THE POLICE
cv-valid-train-sample-000612 BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
cv-valid-train-sample-000616 HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000618 ONE MUST PREPARE FOR IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000621 IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
cv-valid-train-sample-000622 A MAN DOESN'T GET IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS EVERY DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000623 CAN I GET A WOOT WOOT
cv-valid-train-sample-000625 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000628 IF HE EVER DECIDED TO LEAVE THEM THEY WOULD SUFFER
cv-valid-train-sample-000629 TAKE CHARGE OF HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000630 I LOST MY WALLET
cv-valid-train-sample-000631 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
cv-valid-train-sample-000632 HE'S NUTS ABOUT YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000633 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
cv-valid-train-sample-000635 IT'S THE OTHER FOREIGNER THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000636 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000638 YOU'LL NEVER GET IT OUT OF ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000639 IT WAS THE PURE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000640 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000641 I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000647 WILL I LEARN TO DO THAT SOMEDAY THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000648 THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
cv-valid-train-sample-000649 HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
cv-valid-train-sample-000652 IT HAD TOLD HIM TO DIG WHERE HIS TEARS FELL
cv-valid-train-sample-000654 MOHAMMED IS A WONDERFUL GUITAR PLAYER
cv-valid-train-sample-000655 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000659 LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000660 THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
cv-valid-train-sample-000665 IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY
cv-valid-train-sample-000669 I'M GOING TO THEM
cv-valid-train-sample-000672 THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000673 AND THE LAST ONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000674 A LOT OF MONEY
cv-valid-train-sample-000677 I SAID I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN
cv-valid-train-sample-000679 I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000681 THERE WAS A HOLE THERE AMONG THE STONES
cv-valid-train-sample-000682 LICORICE IS A BLACK CHEWY FOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000683 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000686 HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
cv-valid-train-sample-000687 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000688 THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000690 I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT MY HORIZON HAS EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000692 THOSE GYPSIES ARE REALLY SMART HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000693 DO I LOOK AS FUNNY AS YOU DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000694 BUT I'M LIABLE TO GET INTO A JAM
cv-valid-train-sample-000695 ALL THE VILLAGERS CHEERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000702 BECAUSE HE WAS TERRIFIED THE BOY DIDN'T ANSWER
cv-valid-train-sample-000705 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000707 WHAT GOOD IS MONEY TO YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000709 SORT OF A JACK LONDON STYLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000710 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000711 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000712 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000714 WELL THEN HELP ME DO THAT THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000715 I AM HERE THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000718 DO YOU SEE THIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000720 THE LIBRARY IS OPEN TO EVERYONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000721 THAT'S COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES
cv-valid-train-sample-000722 IT WAS A TENT LIKE MANY AT THE OASIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000724 SHE WROTE THE STUFF
cv-valid-train-sample-000729 I NEVER SAW AMANDA ACT LIKE THAT BEFORE
cv-valid-train-sample-000731 OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000734 BECAUSE NOW HE KNEW WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS
cv-valid-train-sample-000735 DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET HIDING PLACE HERE IN THE HOUSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000736 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000737 I'M GOING TO NEED IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000739 I BET YOU FORGOT THE WINE
cv-valid-train-sample-000741 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train-sample-000742 THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000744 IS THERE A MRS JOSHUA
cv-valid-train-sample-000746 YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
cv-valid-train-sample-000747 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
cv-valid-train-sample-000749 THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000751 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
cv-valid-train-sample-000752 THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED
cv-valid-train-sample-000753 WHAT TRICKS WOULD I PULL
cv-valid-train-sample-000758 BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
cv-valid-train-sample-000759 FEBRUARY TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES
cv-valid-train-sample-000763 UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000765 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ROMANTIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000768 THE ELEVATORS ARE STILL RUNNING
cv-valid-train-sample-000770 THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
cv-valid-train-sample-000773 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000775 HAVE YOU GOT A MIRROR
cv-valid-train-sample-000776 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000779 THE PILOTS BRACED THEMSELVES FOR IMPACT
cv-valid-train-sample-000784 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
cv-valid-train-sample-000788 I CAN EXPLAIN IF YOU'LL JUST LISTEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000790 IT'S NOT A LIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000793 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000794 NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000797 JUST AS A RULE OF THUMB
cv-valid-train-sample-000800 GET ME WALTER BURNS
cv-valid-train-sample-000801 HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF
cv-valid-train-sample-000802 PEOPLE CONTINUED TO COME AND GO FROM THE BAKER'S SHOP
cv-valid-train-sample-000805 WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
cv-valid-train-sample-000807 I WISH YOU'D FORGET ABOUT US
cv-valid-train-sample-000808 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000811 THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING
cv-valid-train-sample-000812 MY ALLERGY HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE TODAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000814 BEEN SEEING ME IN YOUR DREAMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000816 SHE NEVER GREW UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000817 THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
cv-valid-train-sample-000819 MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000820 SAME WAY YOU DID
cv-valid-train-sample-000824 I WANT THOSE STAMPS
cv-valid-train-sample-000825 I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000827 THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000829 BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train-sample-000830 YOU WILL NEVER REOPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000831 YOU DONT COMPARE DIRECTLY TO EXISTING STATEOFTHEART METHODS
cv-valid-train-sample-000835 AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000842 WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000844 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000853 I'M AFRAID THE JOKE'S ON US
cv-valid-train-sample-000855 THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000856 THE BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS A SURPRISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000858 YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000859 AND WHAT A WAY TO QUIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000861 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000862 AND STOP THREATENING THAT BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000863 THEN HE TURNED TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000866 THE MONK WAS IRRITATED
cv-valid-train-sample-000869 CAN'T YOU READ ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000870 ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000871 DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000873 THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000874 HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
cv-valid-train-sample-000875 WILL YOU GIVE ME THOSE STAMPS
cv-valid-train-sample-000876 I LEFT HER HANGING AROUND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS
cv-valid-train-sample-000877 HE HAD BEEN TO THE VILLAGE ONLY ONCE THE YEAR BEFORE
cv-valid-train-sample-000882 LOOK AT THOSE SHOULDERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000883 THE SUN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE
cv-valid-train-sample-000884 SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000885 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000886 I WILL BE BACK SOON
cv-valid-train-sample-000888 MRS SARAH DOESN'T EITHER
cv-valid-train-sample-000889 WELLI DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000891 I THOUGHT YOU WERE CHASING ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000894 THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
cv-valid-train-sample-000896 I GOTTA FIGURE SOME WAY OUT OF THIS THING
cv-valid-train-sample-000897 IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000900 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000903 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
cv-valid-train-sample-000904 ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
cv-valid-train-sample-000905 I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE HIM SINCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000908 THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SO DID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000909 WHO TOLD YOU THAT ASKED THE BOY STARTLED
cv-valid-train-sample-000911 MY FATHER OFFERED HER A JOB
cv-valid-train-sample-000912 IT WAS PAPA THAT SENDS YOU FLOWERS EVERY DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000914 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
cv-valid-train-sample-000915 I JUMPED IN TO SAVE RACHEL
cv-valid-train-sample-000917 IS THE HEAD BETTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000918 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
cv-valid-train-sample-000919 THAT WOMAN IS GONNA BE ON THAT ROOF
cv-valid-train-sample-000920 I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
cv-valid-train-sample-000922 HE RECITED AN OUR FATHER SILENTLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000924 AND HERE'S A KISS FOR YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000925 WHO WROTE THAT SPEECH FOR YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000926 SAVE THAT FOR THE TRIBUNE
cv-valid-train-sample-000927 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train-sample-000929 I DON'T LIKE SEALS ANYHOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000932 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO LEARN
cv-valid-train-sample-000933 YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000936 NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECKPOINTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000943 THEN A MAN APPROACHED
cv-valid-train-sample-000945 AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
cv-valid-train-sample-000951 I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000955 THE MEETING WAS OVER
cv-valid-train-sample-000957 THAT WASN'T AT ALL NECESSARY
cv-valid-train-sample-000960 WERE THEY QUICK OR WERE THEY ENRAGED
cv-valid-train-sample-000961 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000962 AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
cv-valid-train-sample-000964 THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000966 AND THIS IS WHAT YOUR SON SAID THE ANGEL TOLD THE MAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000967 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train-sample-000968 WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS
cv-valid-train-sample-000970 HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000972 IF IT WOULD SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE
cv-valid-train-sample-000973 HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
cv-valid-train-sample-000974 THEY WERE ALL FURIOUS WHEN THE ESCAPADE FAILED
cv-valid-train-sample-000976 WHERE ARE YOU BOUND ASKED THE YOUNG ARAB
cv-valid-train-sample-000978 I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000979 I'M NOT AFRAID OF FAILING
cv-valid-train-sample-000980 SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON
cv-valid-train-sample-000982 ANY DOPE YET ON HOW HE GOT OUT
cv-valid-train-sample-000983 THEY'RE NOT FOR SALE HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000985 MIND IF I SIT DOWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000988 MR BEAN IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF A BRITISH COMEDY
cv-valid-train-sample-000992 BUTMAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
cv-valid-train-sample-000994 EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM
cv-valid-train-sample-000995 IT WAS ENGINEERING AT ITS FINEST
cv-valid-train-sample-000996 ALL THINGS ARE ONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000999 HOW ABOUT ONCE MORE AROUND THE PARK
