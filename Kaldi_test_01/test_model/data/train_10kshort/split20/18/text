cv-valid-train-sample-000862 AND STOP THREATENING THAT BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000863 THEN HE TURNED TO THE BOY

cv-valid-train-sample-000869 CAN'T YOU READ ME

cv-valid-train-sample-000896 I GOTTA FIGURE SOME WAY OUT OF THIS THING
cv-valid-train-sample-000897 IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000900 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000903 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
