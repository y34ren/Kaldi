cv-valid-train-sample-000251 I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000254 IT ALL HAPPENED RATHER SUDDENLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000255 SURE SEE YOU THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000256 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train-sample-000260 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
cv-valid-train-sample-000262 THIS IS JON DAVIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000263 THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000267 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
cv-valid-train-sample-000273 I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
cv-valid-train-sample-000274 I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000277 THERE IS A REPTILE IN MY WESTERN SHOES
cv-valid-train-sample-000279 I WANT TO STAY AT THE OASIS THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000280 AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
cv-valid-train-sample-000281 WHAT'S IN THAT DESK
cv-valid-train-sample-000284 THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000287 EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000288 BECAUSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WOULD FIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000290 THE BOY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000293 WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000294 THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000295 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
cv-valid-train-sample-000303 I DON'T KNOW YOU FROM ADAM
cv-valid-train-sample-000304 THEY WERE RACING DOWN THE STREETS WITH NO REGARD FOR ANYONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000305 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000307 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
