cv-valid-train-sample-000356 THERE WAS NO OTHER BAGGAGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000357 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
cv-valid-train-sample-000358 DID YOU SAY A KING HE ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000359 WHAT HE SAID REMINDED THE BOY OF THE OLD KING
cv-valid-train-sample-000366 IT'S THE ONLY NAME I'VE GOT
cv-valid-train-sample-000369 I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS
cv-valid-train-sample-000370 IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE
cv-valid-train-sample-000371 THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000372 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000375 MY KEYCHAIN IS HEAVY AND AWKWARD TO CARRY IN MY POCKET
cv-valid-train-sample-000376 I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000378 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000379 I KNOW THAT GIRL
cv-valid-train-sample-000380 HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000381 BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000383 LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
cv-valid-train-sample-000387 HOW COULD HE BE A FAKE
cv-valid-train-sample-000391 I FEEL LIKE A BOOTLEGGER
cv-valid-train-sample-000393 THEN GET OUT OF HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000394 THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
cv-valid-train-sample-000395 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000398 YOU ALL KNOW ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000400 I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THAT TUB
cv-valid-train-sample-000403 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000406 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
