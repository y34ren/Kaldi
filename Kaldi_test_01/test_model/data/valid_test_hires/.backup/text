cv-valid-test-sample-000000 WITHOUT THE DATASET THE ARTICLE IS USELESS
cv-valid-test-sample-000001 I'VE GOT TO GO TO HIM
cv-valid-test-sample-000002 AND YOU KNOW IT
cv-valid-test-sample-000003 DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
cv-valid-test-sample-000004 HOLD YOUR NOSE TO KEEP THE SMELL FROM DISABLING YOUR MOTOR FUNCTIONS
cv-valid-test-sample-000005 DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
cv-valid-test-sample-000006 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-test-sample-000007 THE SHEEP HAD TAUGHT HIM THAT
cv-valid-test-sample-000008 THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
cv-valid-test-sample-000009 IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND
cv-valid-test-sample-000010 YOUR SON WENT TO SERVE AT A DISTANT PLACE AND BECAME A CENTURION
cv-valid-test-sample-000011 THEY MADE THE BOY CONTINUE DIGGING BUT HE FOUND NOTHING
cv-valid-test-sample-000012 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
cv-valid-test-sample-000013 THE SHOWER'S IN THERE
cv-valid-test-sample-000014 FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS HERE
cv-valid-test-sample-000015 THEY'RE CALLING TO US NOT TO GIVE UP AND TO KEEP ON FIGHTING
cv-valid-test-sample-000016 THE SHOP IS CLOSED ON MONDAYS
cv-valid-test-sample-000017 EVEN COMING DOWN ON THE TRAIN TOGETHER SHE WROTE ME
cv-valid-test-sample-000018 I'M GOING AWAY HE SAID
cv-valid-test-sample-000019 IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
cv-valid-test-sample-000020 I'M GOING INTO THE DESERT THE MAN ANSWERED TURNING BACK TO HIS READING
cv-valid-test-sample-000021 HE WASN'T ASKING FOR HELP
cv-valid-test-sample-000022 SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
cv-valid-test-sample-000023 EVERYONE WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG KNOWS WHAT THEIR DESTINY IS
cv-valid-test-sample-000024 I'D LIKE TO THINK
cv-valid-test-sample-000025 THE ALCHEMIST PROBABLY ALREADY KNEW ALL THAT
cv-valid-test-sample-000026 YOU'LL TAKE FIFTY AND LIKE IT
cv-valid-test-sample-000027 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
cv-valid-test-sample-000028 WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
cv-valid-test-sample-000029 IT'S BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT BORN
cv-valid-test-sample-000030 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT
cv-valid-test-sample-000031 IF I HAD TOLD YOU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THE PYRAMIDS
cv-valid-test-sample-000032 I HAVEN'T HEARD THE BABY COMPLAIN YET
cv-valid-test-sample-000033 I TOLD HIM WE COULD TEACH HER TO IGNORE PEOPLE WHO WASTE HER TIME
cv-valid-test-sample-000034 THE ONE YOU'RE BLOCKING
cv-valid-test-sample-000035 HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
cv-valid-test-sample-000036 HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK OUT THE OLD WOMAN FOR THIS
cv-valid-test-sample-000037 ONLY A MINORITY OF LITERATURE IS WRITTEN THIS WAY
cv-valid-test-sample-000038 I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
cv-valid-test-sample-000039 NATURE KNOWS ME AS THE WISEST BEING IN CREATION THE SUN SAID
cv-valid-test-sample-000040 THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO LEARN THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-test-sample-000041 DON'T DO IT FOR ME
cv-valid-test-sample-000042 I'M NOT WORKING FOR ANY OTHER PAPER
cv-valid-test-sample-000043 THAT'S NOT SO BAD
cv-valid-test-sample-000044 I HAVE THE DIET OF A KID WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLARS
cv-valid-test-sample-000045 I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP
cv-valid-test-sample-000046 THE BOY LOOKED OUT AT THE HORIZON
cv-valid-test-sample-000047 NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT
cv-valid-test-sample-000048 THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
cv-valid-test-sample-000049 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
cv-valid-test-sample-000050 I MAKE MY LIVING FORECASTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE HE SAID
cv-valid-test-sample-000051 NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND
cv-valid-test-sample-000052 HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-test-sample-000053 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-test-sample-000054 ALL THEY THINK ABOUT IS FOOD AND WATER
cv-valid-test-sample-000055 SHAKESPEARE NEVER SAID THAT
cv-valid-test-sample-000056 YOU NEED TO SEE THIS
cv-valid-test-sample-000057 THE BOY KNEW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CITY
cv-valid-test-sample-000058 FRANK WAS DYING SO THEY WERE FORCED TO LEAVE HIM
cv-valid-test-sample-000059 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
cv-valid-test-sample-000060 THE BOY REMINDED THE OLD MAN THAT HE HAD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HIDDEN TREASURE
cv-valid-test-sample-000061 DON'T POINT THE GUN AT ME
cv-valid-test-sample-000062 HE'S THE MAN THE ADS ARE WRITTEN FOR
cv-valid-test-sample-000063 THERE WAS NO EXCUSE FOR GOODMAN TO FLY OFF THE HANDLE
cv-valid-test-sample-000064 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-test-sample-000065 I TOLD YOU TO HAVE THE ICE BOX FIXED
cv-valid-test-sample-000066 IT'S LATE IN THE EVENING A PERFECT TIME FOR COFFEE
cv-valid-test-sample-000067 I'M COMING FATIMA HE SAID
cv-valid-test-sample-000068 DON'T DO IT FOR ME
cv-valid-test-sample-000069 I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
cv-valid-test-sample-000070 HE FELT INVISIBLE AMONG ALL THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE
cv-valid-test-sample-000071 HE THOUGHT OF ALL THE MARRIED SHEPHERDS HE HAD KNOWN
cv-valid-test-sample-000072 YOU MEAN SPIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
cv-valid-test-sample-000073 BUT FINALLY THE MERCHANT APPEARED AND ASKED THE BOY TO SHEAR FOUR SHEEP
cv-valid-test-sample-000074 I JUST GOT RID OF ONE CROWD
cv-valid-test-sample-000075 EVERY SEARCH BEGINS WITH BEGINNER'S LUCK
cv-valid-test-sample-000076 YOU CAN'T BE THE WIND THE WIND SAID
cv-valid-test-sample-000077 HE HAD SURPRISED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT
cv-valid-test-sample-000078 HE WAS GOING TO MISS THE PLACE AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS HE HAD LEARNED
cv-valid-test-sample-000079 AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
cv-valid-test-sample-000080 MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
cv-valid-test-sample-000081 IT'S CANDICE NOW ON LONG DISTANCE FROM WASHINGTON
cv-valid-test-sample-000082 HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD
cv-valid-test-sample-000083 THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS
cv-valid-test-sample-000084 DO YOU KNOW WHAT
cv-valid-test-sample-000085 THEY WENT IN TO DRINK THE TEA WHICH WAS SERVED IN BEAUTIFUL CRYSTAL GLASSES
cv-valid-test-sample-000086 THIS IS FOR YOU
cv-valid-test-sample-000087 THEY WERE MEN OF THE DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF SORCERERS
cv-valid-test-sample-000088 THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
cv-valid-test-sample-000089 IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
cv-valid-test-sample-000090 AREN'T YOU GOING TO TELL ME
cv-valid-test-sample-000091 THAT'S TRUE THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-test-sample-000092 WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
cv-valid-test-sample-000093 DURING ONE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THE DRIVER TOLD OF HIS OWN LIFE
cv-valid-test-sample-000094 ISN'T THE PARTY ALSO TO ANNOUNCE HIS ENGAGEMENT TO JOANNA
cv-valid-test-sample-000095 HE REMEMBERED SOMETHING HIS GRANDFATHER HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT BUTTERFLIES WERE A GOOD OMEN
cv-valid-test-sample-000096 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
cv-valid-test-sample-000097 HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
cv-valid-test-sample-000098 EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
cv-valid-test-sample-000099 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-test-sample-000100 IT KNEW OF THE BOY'S TALK WITH THE DESERT BECAUSE THE WINDS KNOW EVERYTHING
cv-valid-test-sample-000101 ALL THEY THINK ABOUT IS FOOD AND WATER
cv-valid-test-sample-000102 AFTER THE DICTATOR'S RULE OF FOURTY THREE YEARS WAS OVER THE COUNTRY WAS DEVASTATED
cv-valid-test-sample-000103 ONLY WHEN HE CONSENTS
cv-valid-test-sample-000104 THE CAMEL DRIVER WAS SEATED AT THE BASE OF A PALM TREE OBSERVING THE SUNSET
cv-valid-test-sample-000105 ALL THEY EVER DO REALLY IS LOOK FOR FOOD AND WATER
cv-valid-test-sample-000106 SURE YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO IN WITH YOU
cv-valid-test-sample-000107 I WANT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
cv-valid-test-sample-000108 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-test-sample-000109 SOME STORMS ARE WORTH THE WRECKAGE
cv-valid-test-sample-000110 IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
cv-valid-test-sample-000111 MODERN SEWING MACHINES CAN THROTTLE THEIR SPEED
cv-valid-test-sample-000112 IT'S AS MUCH MY FAULT AS YOURS
cv-valid-test-sample-000113 IMAGE REGISTRATION COULD BE EASILY INCORPORATED INTO LOWPOWER EMBEDDED DEVICES
cv-valid-test-sample-000114 THE MERCHANTS WERE ASSEMBLING THEIR STALLS AND THE BOY HELPED A CANDY SELLER TO DO HIS
cv-valid-test-sample-000115 YOU DON'T DENY THAT
cv-valid-test-sample-000116 THEY MADE THE BOY CONTINUE DIGGING BUT HE FOUND NOTHING
cv-valid-test-sample-000117 THEN HE SAT IN THE SUNFILLED DOORWAY SMOKING THE HOOKAH
cv-valid-test-sample-000118 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
cv-valid-test-sample-000119 IT SAID THAT THE DARKEST HOUR OF THE NIGHT CAME JUST BEFORE THE DAWN
cv-valid-test-sample-000120 ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-test-sample-000121 I CAN'T LET YOU HAVE MY PLANE
cv-valid-test-sample-000122 IF WHAT ONE FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTER IT WILL NEVER SPOIL
cv-valid-test-sample-000123 HE PUT HIS HEADCLOTH IN PLACE AND SECURED IT WITH A RING MADE OF CAMEL SKIN
cv-valid-test-sample-000124 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
cv-valid-test-sample-000125 THE ENGLISHMAN ASKED IF THEY WERE IN DANGER
cv-valid-test-sample-000126 SUN IS BETTER THAN RAIN
cv-valid-test-sample-000127 THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
cv-valid-test-sample-000128 YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
cv-valid-test-sample-000129 IT'S THE MASTER WORK OF THE ALCHEMISTS
cv-valid-test-sample-000130 THEY WENT ON SMOKING THE PIPE FOR A WHILE AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SET
cv-valid-test-sample-000131 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
cv-valid-test-sample-000132 FROM HERE ON YOU WILL BE ALONE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-test-sample-000133 THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
cv-valid-test-sample-000134 IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
cv-valid-test-sample-000135 SOMETIMES I GET SO MAD AT YOU I CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT
cv-valid-test-sample-000136 ON OUR WAY TO SAN FRANCISCO WE WERE LISTENING TO REGGAE MUSIC AND SMOKING WEED
cv-valid-test-sample-000137 WORK FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
cv-valid-test-sample-000138 MANY OF OUR SOLDIERS TEAMED UP
cv-valid-test-sample-000139 AM I GOING TO FIND MY TREASURE HE ASKED
cv-valid-test-sample-000140 HELIUM MAKES YOUR VOICE HIGH PITCHED
cv-valid-test-sample-000141 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-test-sample-000142 THE BOY CLOSED HIS BOOK
cv-valid-test-sample-000143 YOU MEAN THE ONE WHO DRANK SO MUCH
cv-valid-test-sample-000144 THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
cv-valid-test-sample-000145 MRS SARAH DOESN'T EITHER
cv-valid-test-sample-000146 HIS EXPRESSION REMINDED ME OF A HORSE CHEWING HAY
cv-valid-test-sample-000147 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
cv-valid-test-sample-000148 NATURALLY WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
cv-valid-test-sample-000149 MAKE SURE YOU'VE READ MY INTRODUCTORY POST ON VOICE CODING SINCE WE WILL BE BUILDING UPON THAT
cv-valid-test-sample-000150 HE TOLD FATIMA THAT AT THEIR NEXT MEETING
cv-valid-test-sample-000151 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
cv-valid-test-sample-000152 MAYBE THE WATER WAS TOO HOT
cv-valid-test-sample-000153 A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
cv-valid-test-sample-000154 HE REALLY WAS A KING A WISE KING
cv-valid-test-sample-000155 A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
cv-valid-test-sample-000156 HE NEEDS THREE DAYS ANSWERED THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-test-sample-000157 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
cv-valid-test-sample-000158 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME EITHER HAD TOUCHED THE OTHER
cv-valid-test-sample-000159 I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW
cv-valid-test-sample-000160 THEN CONNECT TO LOCALHOST WITHIN WINDOWS
cv-valid-test-sample-000161 AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
cv-valid-test-sample-000162 THE BOY CLOSED HIS BOOK
cv-valid-test-sample-000163 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
cv-valid-test-sample-000164 THE CHAIR LIFT TOOK THEM UP THE MOUNTAIN
cv-valid-test-sample-000165 SOMEBODY HAD RETURNED MY LOST CREDIT CARD TO THE BANK
cv-valid-test-sample-000166 BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
cv-valid-test-sample-000167 THAT DOESN'T SAY MUCH FOR MINE
cv-valid-test-sample-000168 DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE
cv-valid-test-sample-000169 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
cv-valid-test-sample-000170 HOW AM I GOING TO LIVE UNTIL THE BANK OPENS
cv-valid-test-sample-000171 LIZ PUT THE FLOWERS INTO A MIRRORED VASE
cv-valid-test-sample-000172 HE PREPARED HIMSELF A SANDWICH AND DRANK SOME HOT TEA FROM A CRYSTAL GLASS
cv-valid-test-sample-000173 PROMISE YOU'LL NEVER LIE THE WAY SNOOPY DID
cv-valid-test-sample-000174 THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
cv-valid-test-sample-000175 A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
cv-valid-test-sample-000176 THEN SHE TOOK BOTH OF HIS HANDS IN HERS AND BEGAN QUIETLY TO PRAY
cv-valid-test-sample-000177 YOU'D THINK I WAS ON THE WITNESS STAND
cv-valid-test-sample-000178 THE EMERALD TABLET IS A DIRECT PASSAGE TO THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-test-sample-000179 I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU
cv-valid-test-sample-000180 THIS IS FOR YOU
cv-valid-test-sample-000181 MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
cv-valid-test-sample-000182 JUST GIVE ME A FEW HOURS BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY DECISIONS
cv-valid-test-sample-000183 AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE MAN LIVED
cv-valid-test-sample-000184 IN ONE HE HAD READ THAT MANY YEARS AGO A FAMOUS ARABIAN ALCHEMIST HAD VISITED EUROPE
cv-valid-test-sample-000185 ONE IS LOVED BECAUSE ONE IS LOVED
cv-valid-test-sample-000186 THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES
cv-valid-test-sample-000187 EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
cv-valid-test-sample-000188 I'D HATE TO HAVE THAT MANY PINS STUCK IN ME
cv-valid-test-sample-000189 I MET A MAN WITH SHARP NAILS
cv-valid-test-sample-000190 ONLY THE LIGHTS IN THE GREAT TENT REMAINED
cv-valid-test-sample-000191 APPARENTLY IT'S THE DUMPLINGS THAT MAKE THIS STEW TASTE SO GOOD
cv-valid-test-sample-000192 WHEN SHE SAW THE UNKNOWN OBJECT BOBBING UP AND DOWN THE EDGE SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED
cv-valid-test-sample-000193 I HAVE KNOWN TRUE ALCHEMISTS THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED
cv-valid-test-sample-000194 HE REALLY WAS A KING A WISE KING
cv-valid-test-sample-000195 WHAT ARE THESE THINGS HE ASKED
cv-valid-test-sample-000196 I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
cv-valid-test-sample-000197 I NEVER SAW IT BEFORE
cv-valid-test-sample-000198 I'M PROUD OF IT
cv-valid-test-sample-000199 THE BOY WAS EMBARRASSED AND CONFESSED THAT HE HAD OBSERVED NOTHING
