cv-valid-train-sample-000400 I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THAT TUB
cv-valid-train-sample-000401 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000402 THIS DESERT WAS ONCE A SEA HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000403 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000404 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000405 HE HAD NO IDEA HOW HE WAS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000406 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
cv-valid-train-sample-000407 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000408 THAT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000409 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000410 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
cv-valid-train-sample-000411 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
cv-valid-train-sample-000412 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000413 SHE JOINED UP TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000414 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000415 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
cv-valid-train-sample-000416 THERE'S LIFE HERE THE BOY SAID TO THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000417 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
cv-valid-train-sample-000418 I'M GOING TO THEM
cv-valid-train-sample-000419 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000420 IT BELONGS TO ME NOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000421 HAS HE BEEN HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000422 BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
cv-valid-train-sample-000423 YOU SAID YOU WANTED FIREWORKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000424 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
cv-valid-train-sample-000425 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
cv-valid-train-sample-000426 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train-sample-000427 I WISH THEY WERE TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000428 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
cv-valid-train-sample-000429 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
cv-valid-train-sample-000430 THEY WERE ALWAYS JUST SOMEBODY TO FILL UP THE BLEACHERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000431 DONT FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE IT WOULD NOT HELP
cv-valid-train-sample-000432 THERE WAS A SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE STATUE
cv-valid-train-sample-000433 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000434 HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000435 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000436 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000437 NOBODY'S TRYING TO STEAL FROM YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000438 BUT HE FOUND IT MUCH MORE INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THE CARAVAN AND LISTEN TO THE WIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000439 IT CONSIDERS THE HORIZONTAL DIMENSION AS TIME
cv-valid-train-sample-000440 HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED
cv-valid-train-sample-000441 ALWAYS HEED THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000442 IT COMMENCED TO BLOW HARDER RAISING THE DESERT SANDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000443 WELL WHAT GOOD WOULD IT BE TO YOU IF YOU HAD T DIE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000444 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000445 CAROL SAVED HER BROTHER'S LIFE THAT DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000446 IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000447 THAT HE HAD ATTENDED A SEMINARY UNTIL HE WAS SIXTEEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000448 I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000449 KEEP HIM IN HERE
