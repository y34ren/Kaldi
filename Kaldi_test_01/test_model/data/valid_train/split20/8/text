cv-valid-train-sample-000350 THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000351 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000352 IT'S THE ONLY ONE THEY HAD LEFT
cv-valid-train-sample-000353 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000354 HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000355 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
cv-valid-train-sample-000356 THERE WAS NO OTHER BAGGAGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000357 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
cv-valid-train-sample-000358 DID YOU SAY A KING HE ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000359 WHAT HE SAID REMINDED THE BOY OF THE OLD KING
cv-valid-train-sample-000360 BUT WE COULD SELL TEA IN CRYSTAL GLASSES
cv-valid-train-sample-000361 HE WAS THINKING ABOUT OMENS AND SOMEONE HAD APPEARED
cv-valid-train-sample-000362 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
cv-valid-train-sample-000363 IN THE DISCOTHEQUE THE DJ PLAYED PROGRESSIVE HOUSE MUSIC AND TRANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000364 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
cv-valid-train-sample-000365 I'VE WATCHED YOU GROW UP FROM A LITTLE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000366 IT'S THE ONLY NAME I'VE GOT
cv-valid-train-sample-000367 THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
cv-valid-train-sample-000368 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000369 I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS
cv-valid-train-sample-000370 IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE
cv-valid-train-sample-000371 THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000372 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000373 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000374 BUT AS TIME PASSED TANGIER HAD CHANGED
cv-valid-train-sample-000375 MY KEYCHAIN IS HEAVY AND AWKWARD TO CARRY IN MY POCKET
cv-valid-train-sample-000376 I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000377 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
cv-valid-train-sample-000378 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000379 I KNOW THAT GIRL
cv-valid-train-sample-000380 HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000381 BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000382 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000383 LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
cv-valid-train-sample-000384 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000385 HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000386 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000387 HOW COULD HE BE A FAKE
cv-valid-train-sample-000388 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
cv-valid-train-sample-000389 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
cv-valid-train-sample-000390 ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
cv-valid-train-sample-000391 I FEEL LIKE A BOOTLEGGER
cv-valid-train-sample-000392 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
cv-valid-train-sample-000393 THEN GET OUT OF HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000394 THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
cv-valid-train-sample-000395 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000396 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000397 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
cv-valid-train-sample-000398 YOU ALL KNOW ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000399 WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PLODDING THROUGH SOME USER INTERVIEWS AT THE MOMENT
