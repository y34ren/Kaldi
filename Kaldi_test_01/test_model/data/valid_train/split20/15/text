cv-valid-train-sample-000700 THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
cv-valid-train-sample-000701 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000702 BECAUSE HE WAS TERRIFIED THE BOY DIDN'T ANSWER
cv-valid-train-sample-000703 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000704 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000705 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000706 IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
cv-valid-train-sample-000707 WHAT GOOD IS MONEY TO YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000708 THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
cv-valid-train-sample-000709 SORT OF A JACK LONDON STYLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000710 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000711 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000712 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000713 BUT HE GRANTED THE TRAVELERS THREE DAYS
cv-valid-train-sample-000714 WELL THEN HELP ME DO THAT THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000715 I AM HERE THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000716 THE ARROW WAS POINTING TO THE EXIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000717 I'M GOING TO GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE DESERT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000718 DO YOU SEE THIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000719 THEY WERE TRIBESMEN DRESSED IN BLUE WITH BLACK RINGS SURROUNDING THEIR TURBANS
cv-valid-train-sample-000720 THE LIBRARY IS OPEN TO EVERYONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000721 THAT'S COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES
cv-valid-train-sample-000722 IT WAS A TENT LIKE MANY AT THE OASIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000723 HE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE PRACTICAL MATTERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000724 SHE WROTE THE STUFF
cv-valid-train-sample-000725 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000726 THE HOOKAHS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUARDS STOOD AT ATTENTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000727 ANOTHER WHO WAS SEARCHING THE BOY'S BAGS FOUND THE PIECE OF GOLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000728 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000729 I NEVER SAW AMANDA ACT LIKE THAT BEFORE
cv-valid-train-sample-000730 THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO COOL
cv-valid-train-sample-000731 OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000732 FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000733 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000734 BECAUSE NOW HE KNEW WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS
cv-valid-train-sample-000735 DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET HIDING PLACE HERE IN THE HOUSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000736 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000737 I'M GOING TO NEED IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000738 I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000739 I BET YOU FORGOT THE WINE
cv-valid-train-sample-000740 NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
cv-valid-train-sample-000741 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train-sample-000742 THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000743 AS HE WAS LEAVING HE SAW IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM HIS OLD SHEPHERD'S POUCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000744 IS THERE A MRS JOSHUA
cv-valid-train-sample-000745 I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000746 YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
cv-valid-train-sample-000747 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
cv-valid-train-sample-000748 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
cv-valid-train-sample-000749 THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
