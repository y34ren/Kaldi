cv-valid-train-sample-000200 THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000201 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000202 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000203 I KNOW ITS DIMENSIONS AND HOW IT BEHAVES
cv-valid-train-sample-000204 OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT
cv-valid-train-sample-000205 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000206 TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000207 GET DOWN QUICK
cv-valid-train-sample-000208 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000209 HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HOLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000210 YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
cv-valid-train-sample-000211 IT WAS HARASSMENT PURE AND SIMPLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000212 THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS CAPE AND THE BOY WAS STRUCK BY WHAT HE SAW
cv-valid-train-sample-000213 HOW WAS THAT FOR A TIGHT SQUEEZE
cv-valid-train-sample-000214 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
cv-valid-train-sample-000215 WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000216 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000217 GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SEASON
cv-valid-train-sample-000218 THE DISPLAY WAS UNDERWHELMING
cv-valid-train-sample-000219 NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FELLOWS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
cv-valid-train-sample-000220 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000221 THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000222 I'M GONNA BUILD AIR FIELDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000223 HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000224 A POX UPON ME FOR A CLUMSY THING
cv-valid-train-sample-000225 STOVE'S HOTTER THAN I THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000226 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000227 THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF
cv-valid-train-sample-000228 IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
cv-valid-train-sample-000229 YOU THINK IT'S EASY
cv-valid-train-sample-000230 THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
cv-valid-train-sample-000231 I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000232 THE WIRELESS JOYPAD WAS EXPERIENCING CONNECTION ISSUES
cv-valid-train-sample-000233 AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000234 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000235 IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000236 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000237 THAT'S WHY ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE NICE
cv-valid-train-sample-000238 THIS IS A TRICK TO GET YOUR SYMPATHY
cv-valid-train-sample-000239 IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000240 THE SHOP WAS BUSY AND THE MAN ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON
cv-valid-train-sample-000241 SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000242 TONIGHT THEY WOULD FIND OUT THE TRUTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000243 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
cv-valid-train-sample-000244 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000245 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000246 HE HAD ASSUMED HE WOULD SOON RETURN TO HIS SHEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000247 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
cv-valid-train-sample-000248 NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000249 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
