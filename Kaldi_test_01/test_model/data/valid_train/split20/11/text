cv-valid-train-sample-000508 IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000509 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
cv-valid-train-sample-000510 THE SPACE WAS SPARTAN ALMOST BARE
cv-valid-train-sample-000511 DO YOU MIND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE CROWDED
cv-valid-train-sample-000512 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000513 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
cv-valid-train-sample-000514 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000515 HE'S THE ONLY HUSBAND I'VE GOT

cv-valid-train-sample-000527 THE BOY APPROACHED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000528 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
cv-valid-train-sample-000529 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000530 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000531 HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
cv-valid-train-sample-000532 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000533 THE BOY FELT ILL AND TERRIBLY ALONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000534 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED

cv-valid-train-sample-000542 VICTORIA DOES THINGS IN A MUCH BIGGER WAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000543 I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000544 I'D HATE TO HAVE THAT MANY PINS STUCK IN ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000545 BUT WHAT'S ALL THIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000546 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000547 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000548 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000549 HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
