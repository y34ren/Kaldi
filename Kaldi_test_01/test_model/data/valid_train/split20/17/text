cv-valid-train-sample-000800 GET ME WALTER BURNS
cv-valid-train-sample-000801 HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF
cv-valid-train-sample-000802 PEOPLE CONTINUED TO COME AND GO FROM THE BAKER'S SHOP
cv-valid-train-sample-000803 THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
cv-valid-train-sample-000804 YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000805 WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
cv-valid-train-sample-000806 FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000807 I WISH YOU'D FORGET ABOUT US
cv-valid-train-sample-000808 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000809 THE BOOK THAT MOST INTERESTED THE BOY TOLD THE STORIES OF THE FAMOUS ALCHEMISTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000810 ARE YOU CRAZY THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON
cv-valid-train-sample-000811 THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING
cv-valid-train-sample-000812 MY ALLERGY HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE TODAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000813 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING AND LOAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000814 BEEN SEEING ME IN YOUR DREAMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000815 THE STRANGER WITHDREW THE SWORD FROM THE BOY'S FOREHEAD AND THE BOY FELT IMMENSELY RELIEVED
cv-valid-train-sample-000816 SHE NEVER GREW UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000817 THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
cv-valid-train-sample-000818 FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
cv-valid-train-sample-000819 MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000820 SAME WAY YOU DID
cv-valid-train-sample-000821 THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000822 WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000823 AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
cv-valid-train-sample-000824 I WANT THOSE STAMPS
cv-valid-train-sample-000825 I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000826 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
cv-valid-train-sample-000827 THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000828 MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
cv-valid-train-sample-000829 BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train-sample-000830 YOU WILL NEVER REOPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000831 YOU DONT COMPARE DIRECTLY TO EXISTING STATEOFTHEART METHODS
cv-valid-train-sample-000832 BUT HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DESIRE THAT AN ARMY INVADE THE OASIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000833 I'M SMOKING TOO MUCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000834 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000835 AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000836 THE TEA SEEMED LESS BITTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000837 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000838 NOT TO WORRY SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000839 EARLIER THIS YEAR WE FOUND A REALLY NICE PLACE NEAR MY OFFICE AND WE MOVED IN TOGETHER
cv-valid-train-sample-000840 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train-sample-000841 THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000842 WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000843 TWO DAYS AGO YOU SAID THAT I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TRAVEL THE MERCHANT ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000844 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000845 HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS WERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000846 MECCA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000847 THAT NIGHT HE TOLD ALL OF THIS TO THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000848 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000849 FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
