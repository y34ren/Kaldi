cv-valid-train-sample-000000 LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000001 EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE EVOLVED HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000002 YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000003 SO NOW I FEAR NOTHING BECAUSE IT WAS THOSE OMENS THAT BROUGHT YOU TO ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000004 IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000005 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000006 NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000007 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
cv-valid-train-sample-000008 PUT JACKIE RIGHT ON THE STAFF
cv-valid-train-sample-000009 WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000010 YOU MUST NOT LET UP EVEN AFTER HAVING COME SO FAR HE CONTINUED
cv-valid-train-sample-000011 IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE WAR IS OVER THEN WAIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000012 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000013 BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE AND DIDN'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY
cv-valid-train-sample-000014 AS THEY BEGAN TO DECORATE THE HALLWAY A SILHOUETTE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000015 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000016 HE WAS MY BROTHER
cv-valid-train-sample-000017 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000018 WE'LL PAY ALL YOUR EXPENSES
cv-valid-train-sample-000019 THEN THEY GOT AHOLD OF SOME DOUGH AND WENT GOOFY
cv-valid-train-sample-000020 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000021 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-train-sample-000022 FILL THIS PLACE WITH A SANDSTORM SO STRONG THAT IT BLOTS OUT THE SUN
cv-valid-train-sample-000023 I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000024 I MAKE MY LIVING FORECASTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000025 I DO WANT THAT PLATINUM RING
cv-valid-train-sample-000026 TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT I HAD A RECURRENT DREAM TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000027 DON'T LET THEM SEE THAT YOU'RE AFRAID THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000028 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
cv-valid-train-sample-000029 THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFF AGAIN BUT WHEN I LOOKED OUTSIDE THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000030 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000031 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000032 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000033 THE YEARS OF RESEARCH THE MAGIC SYMBOLS THE STRANGE WORDS AND THE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000034 I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000035 THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
cv-valid-train-sample-000036 ASK THE OWNER OF THAT STALL HOW MUCH THE SWORD COSTS HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND
cv-valid-train-sample-000037 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
cv-valid-train-sample-000038 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY GIVE UP ON IT SO EARLY TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000039 A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000040 THE SNOW BLASTED ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000041 HAVE A GOOD TRIP
cv-valid-train-sample-000042 TRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU'RE IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000043 SEPARATION OF GARBAGE MAKES RECYCLING POSSIBLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000044 THEY WERE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT AND CLAMORED TO HEAR HIS STORIES ABOUT THE GREAT CITIES
cv-valid-train-sample-000045 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
cv-valid-train-sample-000046 THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COMPANY
cv-valid-train-sample-000047 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000048 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
cv-valid-train-sample-000049 SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
