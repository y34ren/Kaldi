cv-valid-train-sample-000950 THE OLD MAN LEAFED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
cv-valid-train-sample-000951 I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000952 AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000953 THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
cv-valid-train-sample-000954 RELAXED AND UNHURRIED HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD WALK THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF TANGIER
cv-valid-train-sample-000955 THE MEETING WAS OVER
cv-valid-train-sample-000956 ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000957 THAT WASN'T AT ALL NECESSARY
cv-valid-train-sample-000958 I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-train-sample-000959 WHEN HE EMERGED IT WAS WITH A YOUNG ARAB DRESSED IN WHITE AND GOLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000960 WERE THEY QUICK OR WERE THEY ENRAGED
cv-valid-train-sample-000961 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000962 AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
cv-valid-train-sample-000963 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE IN HIS HEART THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO DO SO
cv-valid-train-sample-000964 THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000965 BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TWICE WILL SURELY HAPPEN A THIRD TIME
cv-valid-train-sample-000966 AND THIS IS WHAT YOUR SON SAID THE ANGEL TOLD THE MAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000967 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train-sample-000968 WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS
cv-valid-train-sample-000969 IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER
cv-valid-train-sample-000970 HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000971 YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
cv-valid-train-sample-000972 IF IT WOULD SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE
cv-valid-train-sample-000973 HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
cv-valid-train-sample-000974 THEY WERE ALL FURIOUS WHEN THE ESCAPADE FAILED
cv-valid-train-sample-000975 IT ALWAYS HELPS TO BE LEARNING SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING
cv-valid-train-sample-000976 WHERE ARE YOU BOUND ASKED THE YOUNG ARAB
cv-valid-train-sample-000977 AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000978 I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000979 I'M NOT AFRAID OF FAILING
cv-valid-train-sample-000980 SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON
cv-valid-train-sample-000981 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train-sample-000982 ANY DOPE YET ON HOW HE GOT OUT
cv-valid-train-sample-000983 THEY'RE NOT FOR SALE HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000984 THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
cv-valid-train-sample-000985 MIND IF I SIT DOWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000986 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000987 HE HAD STUDIED LATIN SPANISH AND THEOLOGY
cv-valid-train-sample-000988 MR BEAN IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF A BRITISH COMEDY
cv-valid-train-sample-000989 THE IDEAS SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN A MORE CONCISE AND DIRECT MANNER
cv-valid-train-sample-000990 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
cv-valid-train-sample-000991 I'M GOING TO CHECK UP ON THAT RIGHT AWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000992 BUTMAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
cv-valid-train-sample-000993 I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000994 EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM
cv-valid-train-sample-000995 IT WAS ENGINEERING AT ITS FINEST
cv-valid-train-sample-000996 ALL THINGS ARE ONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000997 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000998 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000999 HOW ABOUT ONCE MORE AROUND THE PARK
