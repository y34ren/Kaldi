cv-valid-train-sample-000600 LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
cv-valid-train-sample-000601 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000602 DON'T MIND THE COLONEL
cv-valid-train-sample-000603 HE THOUGHT OF ALL THE MARRIED SHEPHERDS HE HAD KNOWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000604 I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT
cv-valid-train-sample-000605 AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000606 WHAT IS A FOREIGNER DOING HERE ASKED ANOTHER OF THE MEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000607 AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000608 THERE'S THAT REPRIEVE IF THEY EVER FIND OUT
cv-valid-train-sample-000609 THREE DAYS FROM NOW HE WOULD BE WITH THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000610 IF YOU DON'T STOP FOLLOWING ME I'LL CALL THE POLICE
cv-valid-train-sample-000611 BUT MAYBE PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT WAY HAD NEVER LEARNED THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000612 BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
cv-valid-train-sample-000613 LOOKS LIKE ABOUT TEN YEARS A PIECE FOR YOU BIRDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000614 HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
cv-valid-train-sample-000615 THE OTHER SON WAS A POET AND DELIGHTED ALL OF ROME WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL VERSES
cv-valid-train-sample-000616 HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000617 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000618 ONE MUST PREPARE FOR IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000619 BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUMNI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000620 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000621 IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
cv-valid-train-sample-000622 A MAN DOESN'T GET IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS EVERY DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000623 CAN I GET A WOOT WOOT
cv-valid-train-sample-000624 I THINK IT'S ABOUT BIRD HUNTING BUT NOW I CAN SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED
cv-valid-train-sample-000625 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000626 SUNBURNS CAN BE AVOIDED BY APPLYING SUNSCREEN OR BY STAYING IN THE SHADOWS
cv-valid-train-sample-000627 IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000628 IF HE EVER DECIDED TO LEAVE THEM THEY WOULD SUFFER
cv-valid-train-sample-000629 TAKE CHARGE OF HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000630 I LOST MY WALLET
cv-valid-train-sample-000631 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
cv-valid-train-sample-000632 HE'S NUTS ABOUT YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000633 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
cv-valid-train-sample-000634 I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRANSMITTED BY WORD OF MOUTH HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000635 IT'S THE OTHER FOREIGNER THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000636 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000637 THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOSED OFF THE CONVERSATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000638 YOU'LL NEVER GET IT OUT OF ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000639 IT WAS THE PURE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000640 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000641 I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000642 I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CHANGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000643 IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000644 THEY WENT TO THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE MONASTERY
cv-valid-train-sample-000645 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000646 IF WHAT ONE FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTER IT WILL NEVER SPOIL
cv-valid-train-sample-000647 WILL I LEARN TO DO THAT SOMEDAY THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000648 THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
cv-valid-train-sample-000649 HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
