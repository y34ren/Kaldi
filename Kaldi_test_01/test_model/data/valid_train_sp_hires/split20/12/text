sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000650 BY THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION I SAW THEM STAGGERING AND FALLING AND THEIR SUPPORTERS TURNING TO RUN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000651 AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000652 IT HAD TOLD HIM TO DIG WHERE HIS TEARS FELL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000653 HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000654 MOHAMMED IS A WONDERFUL GUITAR PLAYER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000655 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000656 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000657 A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000658 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000659 LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000660 THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000661 AND HE KNEW WHAT WAS THE FAIR PRICE FOR EVERY ONE OF HIS ANIMALS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000662 MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000663 MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000664 THEY'RE CALLING TO US NOT TO GIVE UP AND TO KEEP ON FIGHTING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000665 IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000666 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000667 OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000668 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000669 I'M GOING TO THEM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000670 I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000671 SUNBURNS CAN BE AVOIDED BY APPLYING SUNSCREEN OR BY STAYING IN THE SHADOWS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000672 THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000673 AND THE LAST ONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000674 A LOT OF MONEY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000675 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000676 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000677 I SAID I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000678 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000679 I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000680 ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE EVERY LIE HE TELLS YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000681 THERE WAS A HOLE THERE AMONG THE STONES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000682 LICORICE IS A BLACK CHEWY FOOD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000683 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000684 THE SHEEP FIDGETED NEARBY UNEASY WITH THEIR NEW OWNER AND EXCITED BY SO MUCH CHANGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000685 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000686 HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000687 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000688 THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000689 I DIDN'T COME HERE TO HAVE YOU READ MY PALM HE SAID ALREADY REGRETTING HAVING COME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000690 I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT MY HORIZON HAS EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000691 IT SORT OF MAKES A FELLOW LOSE FAITH IN HIMSELF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000692 THOSE GYPSIES ARE REALLY SMART HE THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000693 DO I LOOK AS FUNNY AS YOU DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000694 BUT I'M LIABLE TO GET INTO A JAM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000695 ALL THE VILLAGERS CHEERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000696 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000697 THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000698 THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000699 YOU BROUGHT A NEW FEELING INTO MY CRYSTAL SHOP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000700 THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000701 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000702 BECAUSE HE WAS TERRIFIED THE BOY DIDN'T ANSWER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000703 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000704 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000705 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000706 IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000707 WHAT GOOD IS MONEY TO YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000708 THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000709 SORT OF A JACK LONDON STYLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000710 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000711 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000712 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000713 BUT HE GRANTED THE TRAVELERS THREE DAYS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000714 WELL THEN HELP ME DO THAT THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000715 I AM HERE THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000716 THE ARROW WAS POINTING TO THE EXIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000717 I'M GOING TO GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE DESERT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000718 DO YOU SEE THIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000719 THEY WERE TRIBESMEN DRESSED IN BLUE WITH BLACK RINGS SURROUNDING THEIR TURBANS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000720 THE LIBRARY IS OPEN TO EVERYONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000721 THAT'S COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000722 IT WAS A TENT LIKE MANY AT THE OASIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000723 HE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE PRACTICAL MATTERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000724 SHE WROTE THE STUFF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000725 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000726 THE HOOKAHS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUARDS STOOD AT ATTENTION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000727 ANOTHER WHO WAS SEARCHING THE BOY'S BAGS FOUND THE PIECE OF GOLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000728 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000729 I NEVER SAW AMANDA ACT LIKE THAT BEFORE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000730 THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO COOL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000731 OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000732 FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000733 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000734 BECAUSE NOW HE KNEW WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000735 DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET HIDING PLACE HERE IN THE HOUSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000736 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN ANYTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000737 I'M GOING TO NEED IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000738 I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000739 I BET YOU FORGOT THE WINE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000740 NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000741 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000742 THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000743 AS HE WAS LEAVING HE SAW IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM HIS OLD SHEPHERD'S POUCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000744 IS THERE A MRS JOSHUA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000745 I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000746 YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000747 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000748 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000749 THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000750 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000751 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000752 THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000753 WHAT TRICKS WOULD I PULL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000754 THIS SOLUTION ALSO WORKS WELL IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL A LINUX DISTRO ON WINDOWS VIA VIRTUALIZATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000755 BECAUSE FOR HIM YOU ARE A GREEN FIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000756 DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000757 IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000758 BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000759 FEBRUARY TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000760 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000761 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000762 THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000763 UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000764 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000765 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ROMANTIC
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000766 THE FOOTBALL JOCKS LAUGHED VICIOUSLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000767 YOU'RE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000768 THE ELEVATORS ARE STILL RUNNING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000769 BUT USE THEM TO BUY YOUR FLOCK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000770 THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000771 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000772 BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000773 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000774 THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000775 HAVE YOU GOT A MIRROR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000776 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000777 THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000778 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000779 THE PILOTS BRACED THEMSELVES FOR IMPACT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000780 IT WAS A A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000781 LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000782 HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000783 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000784 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000785 HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000786 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000787 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000788 I CAN EXPLAIN IF YOU'LL JUST LISTEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000789 THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000790 IT'S NOT A LIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000791 IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000792 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000793 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000794 NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000795 HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000796 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000797 JUST AS A RULE OF THUMB
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000798 I REALLY DID IT QUITE BRILLIANTLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000799 AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
