sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000700 THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000701 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000702 BECAUSE HE WAS TERRIFIED THE BOY DIDN'T ANSWER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000703 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000704 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000705 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000706 IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000707 WHAT GOOD IS MONEY TO YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000708 THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000709 SORT OF A JACK LONDON STYLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000710 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000711 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000712 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000713 BUT HE GRANTED THE TRAVELERS THREE DAYS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000714 WELL THEN HELP ME DO THAT THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000715 I AM HERE THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000716 THE ARROW WAS POINTING TO THE EXIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000717 I'M GOING TO GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE DESERT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000718 DO YOU SEE THIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000719 THEY WERE TRIBESMEN DRESSED IN BLUE WITH BLACK RINGS SURROUNDING THEIR TURBANS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000720 THE LIBRARY IS OPEN TO EVERYONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000721 THAT'S COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000722 IT WAS A TENT LIKE MANY AT THE OASIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000723 HE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE PRACTICAL MATTERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000724 SHE WROTE THE STUFF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000725 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000726 THE HOOKAHS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUARDS STOOD AT ATTENTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000727 ANOTHER WHO WAS SEARCHING THE BOY'S BAGS FOUND THE PIECE OF GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000728 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000729 I NEVER SAW AMANDA ACT LIKE THAT BEFORE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000730 THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO COOL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000731 OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000732 FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000733 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000734 BECAUSE NOW HE KNEW WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000735 DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET HIDING PLACE HERE IN THE HOUSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000736 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000737 I'M GOING TO NEED IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000738 I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000739 I BET YOU FORGOT THE WINE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000740 NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000741 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000742 THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000743 AS HE WAS LEAVING HE SAW IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM HIS OLD SHEPHERD'S POUCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000744 IS THERE A MRS JOSHUA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000745 I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000746 YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000747 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000748 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000749 THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000750 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000751 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000752 THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000753 WHAT TRICKS WOULD I PULL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000754 THIS SOLUTION ALSO WORKS WELL IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL A LINUX DISTRO ON WINDOWS VIA VIRTUALIZATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000755 BECAUSE FOR HIM YOU ARE A GREEN FIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000756 DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000757 IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000758 BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000759 FEBRUARY TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000760 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000761 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000762 THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000763 UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000764 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000765 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ROMANTIC
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000766 THE FOOTBALL JOCKS LAUGHED VICIOUSLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000767 YOU'RE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000768 THE ELEVATORS ARE STILL RUNNING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000769 BUT USE THEM TO BUY YOUR FLOCK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000770 THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000771 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000772 BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000773 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000774 THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000775 HAVE YOU GOT A MIRROR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000776 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000777 THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000778 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000779 THE PILOTS BRACED THEMSELVES FOR IMPACT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000780 IT WAS A A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000781 LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000782 HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000783 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000784 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000785 HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000786 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000787 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000788 I CAN EXPLAIN IF YOU'LL JUST LISTEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000789 THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000790 IT'S NOT A LIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000791 IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000792 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000793 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000794 NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000795 HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000796 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000797 JUST AS A RULE OF THUMB
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000798 I REALLY DID IT QUITE BRILLIANTLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000799 AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000800 GET ME WALTER BURNS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000801 HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000802 PEOPLE CONTINUED TO COME AND GO FROM THE BAKER'S SHOP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000803 THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000804 YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000805 WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000806 FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000807 I WISH YOU'D FORGET ABOUT US
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000808 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000809 THE BOOK THAT MOST INTERESTED THE BOY TOLD THE STORIES OF THE FAMOUS ALCHEMISTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000810 ARE YOU CRAZY THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000811 THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000812 MY ALLERGY HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE TODAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000813 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING AND LOAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000814 BEEN SEEING ME IN YOUR DREAMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000815 THE STRANGER WITHDREW THE SWORD FROM THE BOY'S FOREHEAD AND THE BOY FELT IMMENSELY RELIEVED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000816 SHE NEVER GREW UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000817 THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000818 FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000819 MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000820 SAME WAY YOU DID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000821 THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000822 WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000823 AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000824 I WANT THOSE STAMPS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000825 I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000826 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000827 THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000828 MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000829 BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000830 YOU WILL NEVER REOPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000831 YOU DONT COMPARE DIRECTLY TO EXISTING STATEOFTHEART METHODS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000832 BUT HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DESIRE THAT AN ARMY INVADE THE OASIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000833 I'M SMOKING TOO MUCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000834 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000835 AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000836 THE TEA SEEMED LESS BITTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000837 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000838 NOT TO WORRY SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000839 EARLIER THIS YEAR WE FOUND A REALLY NICE PLACE NEAR MY OFFICE AND WE MOVED IN TOGETHER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000840 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000841 THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000842 WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000843 TWO DAYS AGO YOU SAID THAT I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TRAVEL THE MERCHANT ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000844 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000845 HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS WERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000846 MECCA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000847 THAT NIGHT HE TOLD ALL OF THIS TO THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000848 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000849 FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
