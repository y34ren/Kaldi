cv-valid-train-sample-000000 LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000001 EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE EVOLVED HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000002 YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000003 SO NOW I FEAR NOTHING BECAUSE IT WAS THOSE OMENS THAT BROUGHT YOU TO ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000004 IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000005 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000006 NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000007 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
cv-valid-train-sample-000008 PUT JACKIE RIGHT ON THE STAFF
cv-valid-train-sample-000009 WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000010 YOU MUST NOT LET UP EVEN AFTER HAVING COME SO FAR HE CONTINUED
cv-valid-train-sample-000011 IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE WAR IS OVER THEN WAIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000012 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000013 BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE AND DIDN'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY
cv-valid-train-sample-000014 AS THEY BEGAN TO DECORATE THE HALLWAY A SILHOUETTE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000015 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000016 HE WAS MY BROTHER
cv-valid-train-sample-000017 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000018 WE'LL PAY ALL YOUR EXPENSES
cv-valid-train-sample-000019 THEN THEY GOT AHOLD OF SOME DOUGH AND WENT GOOFY
cv-valid-train-sample-000020 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000021 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-train-sample-000022 FILL THIS PLACE WITH A SANDSTORM SO STRONG THAT IT BLOTS OUT THE SUN
cv-valid-train-sample-000023 I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000024 I MAKE MY LIVING FORECASTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000025 I DO WANT THAT PLATINUM RING
cv-valid-train-sample-000026 TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT I HAD A RECURRENT DREAM TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000027 DON'T LET THEM SEE THAT YOU'RE AFRAID THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000028 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
cv-valid-train-sample-000029 THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFF AGAIN BUT WHEN I LOOKED OUTSIDE THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000030 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000031 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000032 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000033 THE YEARS OF RESEARCH THE MAGIC SYMBOLS THE STRANGE WORDS AND THE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000034 I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000035 THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
cv-valid-train-sample-000036 ASK THE OWNER OF THAT STALL HOW MUCH THE SWORD COSTS HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND
cv-valid-train-sample-000037 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
cv-valid-train-sample-000038 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY GIVE UP ON IT SO EARLY TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000039 A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000040 THE SNOW BLASTED ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000041 HAVE A GOOD TRIP
cv-valid-train-sample-000042 TRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU'RE IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000043 SEPARATION OF GARBAGE MAKES RECYCLING POSSIBLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000044 THEY WERE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT AND CLAMORED TO HEAR HIS STORIES ABOUT THE GREAT CITIES
cv-valid-train-sample-000045 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
cv-valid-train-sample-000046 THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COMPANY
cv-valid-train-sample-000047 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000048 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
cv-valid-train-sample-000049 SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
cv-valid-train-sample-000050 JUST THE ANT COLONY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000051 SO THE BOY WAS DISAPPOINTED HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN BELIEVE IN DREAMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000052 HOW DO YOU MEAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000053 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT GIRL'S VERY SICK
cv-valid-train-sample-000054 THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000055 THE TRADITION TEACHES MEN HOW TO CROSS THE DESERT AND HOW THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD MARRY
cv-valid-train-sample-000056 I'M EVERYTHING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID I WAS
cv-valid-train-sample-000057 I'M IN A DRUGSTORE
cv-valid-train-sample-000058 IT REQUIRED NO EXPLANATION JUST AS THE UNIVERSE NEEDS NONE AS IT TRAVELS THROUGH ENDLESS TIME
cv-valid-train-sample-000059 FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
cv-valid-train-sample-000060 EVEN IF YOU CLEANED MY CRYSTAL FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000061 MR BRAD CABLES YOU NEED CASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000062 WAIT FOR THE END OF THE WAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000063 HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
cv-valid-train-sample-000064 IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE THE LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000065 YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WITCH DOCTORS HE SPOKE SOME VERSES FROM THE KORAN AND MOVED ON
cv-valid-train-sample-000066 THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
cv-valid-train-sample-000067 IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000068 THE FLOCK OF FLAMINGOS LANDED GRACEFULLY ON THEIR AWKWARD LOOKING LEGS
cv-valid-train-sample-000069 THE BOY WAS SAD AS HE LEFT HER THAT DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000070 SHE WENT OVER TO THE HOSPITAL TO CALL ON PROFESSOR DAVIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000071 THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT HIS DESTINY TO THE END
cv-valid-train-sample-000072 THE CHARCOAL BURNED AWAY TO WHITE ASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000073 THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
cv-valid-train-sample-000074 WHAT IF YOU CAN'T STAND HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000075 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000076 HE DIDN'T NEED TO DEMONSTRATE HIS SCIENCE AND ART TO ANYONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000077 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000078 BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOVE
cv-valid-train-sample-000079 BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000080 WHY DO YOU WANT TO FIND THAT SORT OF PERSON THE ARAB ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000081 THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
cv-valid-train-sample-000082 HOW DO YOU HANDLE THE NEGATIVE WEIGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000083 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
cv-valid-train-sample-000084 AND ALSO BY UNHAPPINESS ENVY AND JEALOUSY
cv-valid-train-sample-000085 TO CALIBRATE THE MOTION CAPTURING SYSTEM PLEASE DO A TPOSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000086 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
cv-valid-train-sample-000087 THE ALCHEMIST FOLLOWED AS THE BOY'S HORSE RAN FOR ALMOST HALF AN HOUR
cv-valid-train-sample-000088 ALL THIS HAPPENED BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNSET THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000089 SHALL I PUT A LITTLE RUM IN THE COFFEE
cv-valid-train-sample-000090 TO NOURISH THE FALCON
cv-valid-train-sample-000091 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000092 WHO IS THIS STRANGER WHO SPEAKS OF OMENS ASKED ONE OF THE CHIEFTAINS EYEING THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000093 HELP MY FRIEND MR RICHARD
cv-valid-train-sample-000094 WANT TO WALK TO NEW YORK
cv-valid-train-sample-000095 DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE
cv-valid-train-sample-000096 I DIDN'T FALL IN
cv-valid-train-sample-000097 IT'S LATE IN THE EVENING A PERFECT TIME FOR COFFEE
cv-valid-train-sample-000098 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000099 THE BOSS SENT ME OVER WITH IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000100 HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
cv-valid-train-sample-000101 THE FUMES FROM THE TRAFFIC WAS UNBEARABLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000102 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
cv-valid-train-sample-000103 THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
cv-valid-train-sample-000104 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000105 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY APPARENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000106 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000107 THE ENGLISHMAN HAD SEVERAL SUITCASES FILLED WITH BOOKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000108 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train-sample-000109 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000110 WISH I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000111 HE STILL CALLS HIS MOTHER MUMMY
cv-valid-train-sample-000112 IT'S COMMON TO RUN INTO PROBLEMS SO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000113 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000114 THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000115 HARRY'LL TEAR HIS DINNER SUIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000116 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000117 YOU'VE GOT HIS GUN
cv-valid-train-sample-000118 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
cv-valid-train-sample-000119 IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT IT MATTERS A LOT
cv-valid-train-sample-000120 WE MUST BE GOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000121 WATCH OVER HER TONIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000122 DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE
cv-valid-train-sample-000123 THERE'S A MOON OUT TONIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000124 THE BOY REPEATED HIS QUESTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000125 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000126 YOU'RE A WEEK LATE FOR SCHOOL ALREADY
cv-valid-train-sample-000127 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
cv-valid-train-sample-000128 YOU HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR DREAMS ABOUT THE OLD KING AND YOUR TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000129 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
cv-valid-train-sample-000130 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000131 THE LEVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
cv-valid-train-sample-000132 WITH THE GIRL WITH THE RAVEN HAIR HIS DAYS WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000133 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
cv-valid-train-sample-000134 WEAR THE BLUE ONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000135 LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOURLEAF CLOVERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000136 I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000137 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000138 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000139 THE TWO WALKED OUT AMONG THE PALMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000140 HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000141 THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000142 MEN HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS OF THE WISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000143 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000144 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
