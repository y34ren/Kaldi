cv-valid-train-sample-000450 MAYBE TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER THAN YESTERDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000451 SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALEX PRETTY WELL
cv-valid-train-sample-000452 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000453 WHEN THE SIMUM CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000454 THE FOREST BURNED FOR THIRTEEN DAYS
cv-valid-train-sample-000455 WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000456 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-train-sample-000457 HE WASHED THE DETRITUS FROM HIS HAIR
cv-valid-train-sample-000458 THAT'S WHAT ALCHEMISTS DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000459 HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000460 THE RESTAURANT WAS QUITE EXPENSIVE
cv-valid-train-sample-000461 PHONE THE NEWSPAPERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000462 HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
cv-valid-train-sample-000463 HE AROSE AND TAKING UP HIS CROOK BEGAN TO AWAKEN THE SHEEP THAT STILL SLEPT
cv-valid-train-sample-000464 THE SHEPHERD SWORE THAT HE WOULD
cv-valid-train-sample-000465 AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000466 MAKTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000467 I DIDN'T FRISK HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000468 HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000469 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
cv-valid-train-sample-000470 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
cv-valid-train-sample-000471 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000472 I'M LEAVING TODAY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000473 THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000474 I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000475 AND TOMORROW HIS ENEMY WOULD ALSO BE A PART OF THAT SOUL
cv-valid-train-sample-000476 I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000477 SO THEN TRY HE SAID TO THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000478 I DON'T BELIEVE IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000479 THE VIRUS SPREAD FASTER THAN WILDFIRE
cv-valid-train-sample-000480 THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000481 I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000482 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000483 PERHAPS SHE MET SOMEBODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000484 TAKE YOUR PAWS OFF ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000485 APPLE PIE IS AN ICONIC DISH
cv-valid-train-sample-000486 AM I GOING TO FIND MY TREASURE HE ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000487 THE ACHIEVED RESULTS ARE FAR BEHIND THE STATEOFTHEART IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000488 THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
cv-valid-train-sample-000489 COACH HAS HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000490 THE SUN WAS TURNED INTO A GOLDEN DISK
cv-valid-train-sample-000491 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000492 THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
cv-valid-train-sample-000493 AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000494 IF HE ABANDONS THAT PURSUIT IT'S BECAUSE IT WASN'T TRUELOVE
cv-valid-train-sample-000495 THE OASIS IS NEUTRAL GROUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000496 WHAT DO YOU SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000497 I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000498 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
cv-valid-train-sample-000499 SURE I KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES
cv-valid-train-sample-000500 HE'S THE MAN THE ADS ARE WRITTEN FOR
cv-valid-train-sample-000501 AND ABOVE ALL DON'T FORGET TO FOLLOW YOUR DESTINY THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION
cv-valid-train-sample-000502 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000503 I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT
cv-valid-train-sample-000504 WE WANT SOME ACTION IN THESE PICTURES
cv-valid-train-sample-000505 SYMBOLS OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000506 THIS GUY STOLE MY WATCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000507 IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WINE HE HAD EVER TASTED
cv-valid-train-sample-000508 IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000509 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
cv-valid-train-sample-000510 THE SPACE WAS SPARTAN ALMOST BARE
cv-valid-train-sample-000511 DO YOU MIND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE CROWDED
cv-valid-train-sample-000512 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000513 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
cv-valid-train-sample-000514 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000515 HE'S THE ONLY HUSBAND I'VE GOT
cv-valid-train-sample-000516 THIS IS FOR YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000517 THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000518 HE NEVER ASKED ME TO SIT DOWN IN HIS LIFE
cv-valid-train-sample-000519 MY NAME'S PETE DAVIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000520 PRETTY NICE NECK YOU'VE GOT THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000521 AN ARMY IS COMING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000522 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN

cv-valid-train-sample-000524 REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOUR HEART IS THERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000525 REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOUR HEART IS THERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000526 I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000527 THE BOY APPROACHED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000528 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
cv-valid-train-sample-000529 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000530 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000531 HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
cv-valid-train-sample-000532 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000533 THE BOY FELT ILL AND TERRIBLY ALONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000534 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train-sample-000535 WILL YOU EXCUSE US A MINUTE
cv-valid-train-sample-000536 I'M LOVING IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000537 AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
cv-valid-train-sample-000538 YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000539 YOUR HEART IS ALIVE
cv-valid-train-sample-000540 PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS VILLAGE SON SAID HIS FATHER
cv-valid-train-sample-000541 AND THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY WELL
cv-valid-train-sample-000542 VICTORIA DOES THINGS IN A MUCH BIGGER WAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000543 I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000544 I'D HATE TO HAVE THAT MANY PINS STUCK IN ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000545 BUT WHAT'S ALL THIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000546 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000547 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000548 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000549 HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000550 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000551 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000552 WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000553 HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
cv-valid-train-sample-000554 DOESNT IT DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF HASHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000555 AND THAT HE A BOY COULD PERFORM MIRACLES
cv-valid-train-sample-000556 IT WON'T HURT YOU AND WE CAN MAKE THE CITY EDITION
cv-valid-train-sample-000557 THE NAVY'S GOING TO FLY FATHER HOME THIS AFTERNOON
cv-valid-train-sample-000558 HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000559 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000560 WE ATE SPICY RICE WITH CHICKEN LEGS AND WHITE MUSHROOMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000561 THE HEAT LASTED UNTIL NIGHTFALL AND ALL THAT TIME HE HAD TO CARRY HIS JACKET
cv-valid-train-sample-000562 AND I'LL SIGN A PAPER
cv-valid-train-sample-000563 THAT'S AN INHERENT DISADVANTAGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000564 I'D BETTER HUSTLE HIM UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000565 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000566 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
cv-valid-train-sample-000567 I'M AFRAID SHE'D FEEL ASHAMED TO THINK SHE HADN'T TRUSTED YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000568 BUT I'M GOING TO EGYPT THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000569 WHAT WERE YOU WHEN YOU CAME HERE FIVE YEARS AGO
cv-valid-train-sample-000570 I GOT IT BACK
cv-valid-train-sample-000571 I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
cv-valid-train-sample-000572 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
cv-valid-train-sample-000573 FASTFOOD IS CONVENIENT BUT OFTEN UNHEALTHY
cv-valid-train-sample-000574 HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE MORNING'S MEETING
cv-valid-train-sample-000575 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
cv-valid-train-sample-000576 THE NEARBY CITY OF CEUTA HAD GROWN FASTER THAN TANGIER AND BUSINESS HAD FALLEN OFF
cv-valid-train-sample-000577 HE'S DEPOSITED TEN DOLLARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000578 ONLY US EXPLORERS CAN GET IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000579 JUST A MEMORY RIGHT NOW IT SIGNIFIED SHADE WATER AND A REFUGE FROM THE WAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000580 THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
cv-valid-train-sample-000581 DIDN'T I TELL YOU NEVER TO COME PANHANDLING AROUND HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000582 THIS WILL HELP YOU EFFECTIVELY COLLABORATE WITH DEVELOPERS AND COORDINATE CROSSTEAM PROJECTS THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER
cv-valid-train-sample-000583 BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000584 BUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT HAD NO CHOICE
cv-valid-train-sample-000585 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000586 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
cv-valid-train-sample-000587 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000588 THE MAN WEPT WITH HAPPINESS
cv-valid-train-sample-000589 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
cv-valid-train-sample-000590 COME IN AGAIN SOME TIME
cv-valid-train-sample-000591 RAISINS ARE DELICIOUS
cv-valid-train-sample-000592 HE WANTED YOUR MONEY HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000593 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000594 MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000595 YOU MUSTN'T LET WHAT SHE SAID BOTHER YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000596 SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME THE SUN ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000597 HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU GET
cv-valid-train-sample-000598 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
cv-valid-train-sample-000599 HOW DO I GUESS AT THE FUTURE
