sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000800 GET ME WALTER BURNS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000801 HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000802 PEOPLE CONTINUED TO COME AND GO FROM THE BAKER'S SHOP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000803 THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000804 YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000805 WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000806 FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000807 I WISH YOU'D FORGET ABOUT US
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000808 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000809 THE BOOK THAT MOST INTERESTED THE BOY TOLD THE STORIES OF THE FAMOUS ALCHEMISTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000810 ARE YOU CRAZY THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000811 THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000812 MY ALLERGY HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE TODAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000813 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING AND LOAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000814 BEEN SEEING ME IN YOUR DREAMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000815 THE STRANGER WITHDREW THE SWORD FROM THE BOY'S FOREHEAD AND THE BOY FELT IMMENSELY RELIEVED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000816 SHE NEVER GREW UP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000817 THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000818 FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000819 MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000820 SAME WAY YOU DID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000821 THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000822 WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000823 AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000824 I WANT THOSE STAMPS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000825 I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000826 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000827 THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000828 MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000829 BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000830 YOU WILL NEVER REOPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000831 YOU DONT COMPARE DIRECTLY TO EXISTING STATEOFTHEART METHODS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000832 BUT HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DESIRE THAT AN ARMY INVADE THE OASIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000833 I'M SMOKING TOO MUCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000834 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000835 AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000836 THE TEA SEEMED LESS BITTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000837 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000838 NOT TO WORRY SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000839 EARLIER THIS YEAR WE FOUND A REALLY NICE PLACE NEAR MY OFFICE AND WE MOVED IN TOGETHER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000840 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000841 THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000842 WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000843 TWO DAYS AGO YOU SAID THAT I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TRAVEL THE MERCHANT ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000844 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000845 HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS WERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000846 MECCA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000847 THAT NIGHT HE TOLD ALL OF THIS TO THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000848 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000849 FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000850 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000851 THE ALCHEMIST ERASED THE CIRCLE IN THE SAND AND THE SNAKE SLITHERED AWAY AMONG THE ROCKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000852 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000853 I'M AFRAID THE JOKE'S ON US
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000854 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000855 THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000856 THE BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS A SURPRISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000857 THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000858 YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000859 AND WHAT A WAY TO QUIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000860 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000861 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000862 AND STOP THREATENING THAT BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000863 THEN HE TURNED TO THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000864 FOR USERS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY CAN TRUST THEIR OPERATING SYSTEM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000865 WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO TO MECCA NOW ASKED THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000866 THE MONK WAS IRRITATED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000867 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000868 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000869 CAN'T YOU READ ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000870 ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE BOY THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000871 DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000872 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000873 THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000874 HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000875 WILL YOU GIVE ME THOSE STAMPS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000876 I LEFT HER HANGING AROUND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000877 HE HAD BEEN TO THE VILLAGE ONLY ONCE THE YEAR BEFORE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000878 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000879 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000880 WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000881 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000882 LOOK AT THOSE SHOULDERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000883 THE SUN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000884 SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000885 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000886 I WILL BE BACK SOON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000887 WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000888 MRS SARAH DOESN'T EITHER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000889 WELLI DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000890 HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000891 I THOUGHT YOU WERE CHASING ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000892 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000893 NOTE THAT IT DOES HAVE BUILTIN SUPPORT FOR WEB BROWSING ALTHOUGH I FIND IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000894 THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000895 THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT SORTS OF FUEL AT THIS GAS STATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000896 I GOTTA FIGURE SOME WAY OUT OF THIS THING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000897 IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000898 THIS BEHAVIOR OF NEURAL NETWORKS IS SOMETIMES CALLED DREAMING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000899 DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000900 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000901 THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000902 THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000903 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000904 ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000905 I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE HIM SINCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000906 I'M AFRAID I MIGHT HAVE SOILED THE COUCH A LITTLE WITH MY SHOES EDDIE MURPHY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000907 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000908 THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SO DID THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000909 WHO TOLD YOU THAT ASKED THE BOY STARTLED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000910 HE DECIDED TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000911 MY FATHER OFFERED HER A JOB
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000912 IT WAS PAPA THAT SENDS YOU FLOWERS EVERY DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000913 ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000914 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000915 I JUMPED IN TO SAVE RACHEL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000916 THAT'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000917 IS THE HEAD BETTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000918 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000919 THAT WOMAN IS GONNA BE ON THAT ROOF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000920 I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000921 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000922 HE RECITED AN OUR FATHER SILENTLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000923 THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000924 AND HERE'S A KISS FOR YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000925 WHO WROTE THAT SPEECH FOR YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000926 SAVE THAT FOR THE TRIBUNE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000927 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000928 SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000929 I DON'T LIKE SEALS ANYHOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000930 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000931 AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000932 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO LEARN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000933 YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000934 THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000935 THE SHIP APPEARED TO BE CONSTRUCTED WITH SOME FORM OF CHROMIUM EXOSKELETON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000936 NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECKPOINTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000937 IT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT GUARANTEES EVERYONE'S FREEDOM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000938 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000939 A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000940 MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000941 YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAY DIE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000942 THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000943 THEN A MAN APPROACHED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000944 BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000945 AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000946 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY ALWAYS STAY CLOSE TO ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000947 I'M AN ALCHEMIST SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M AN ALCHEMIST HE SAID AS HE PREPARED THE MEAL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000948 JENNIFER'S EXPRESSION CHANGED PULL MY FINGER SHE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000949 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
