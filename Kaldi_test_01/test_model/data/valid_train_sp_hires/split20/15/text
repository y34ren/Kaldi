sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000100 HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000101 THE FUMES FROM THE TRAFFIC WAS UNBEARABLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000102 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000103 THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000104 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000105 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY APPARENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000106 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000107 THE ENGLISHMAN HAD SEVERAL SUITCASES FILLED WITH BOOKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000108 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000109 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000110 WISH I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000111 HE STILL CALLS HIS MOTHER MUMMY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000112 IT'S COMMON TO RUN INTO PROBLEMS SO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000113 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000114 THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000115 HARRY'LL TEAR HIS DINNER SUIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000116 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000117 YOU'VE GOT HIS GUN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000118 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000119 IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT IT MATTERS A LOT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000120 WE MUST BE GOOD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000121 WATCH OVER HER TONIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000122 DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000123 THERE'S A MOON OUT TONIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000124 THE BOY REPEATED HIS QUESTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000125 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000126 YOU'RE A WEEK LATE FOR SCHOOL ALREADY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000127 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000128 YOU HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR DREAMS ABOUT THE OLD KING AND YOUR TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000129 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000130 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000131 THE LEVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000132 WITH THE GIRL WITH THE RAVEN HAIR HIS DAYS WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000133 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000134 WEAR THE BLUE ONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000135 LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOURLEAF CLOVERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000136 I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000137 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000138 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000139 THE TWO WALKED OUT AMONG THE PALMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000140 HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000141 THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000142 MEN HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS OF THE WISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000143 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000144 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000145 GET THE BULLETIN BOARD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000146 THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000147 YOU TOLD ME THAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000148 NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000149 DO YOU WANT TO WAKE THAT BABY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000150 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000151 I NEVER STOLE A WATCH IN MY LIFE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000152 GOOD LUCK TO YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000153 MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000154 I WAS JUST ASKING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000155 LET HIM HAVE EVERYTHING HE WANTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000156 THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000157 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000158 EGYPT IS A COUNTRY THAT IS OFTEN MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000159 HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000160 THE BOY KNEW AND WAS NOW WORKING TOWARD IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000161 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000162 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000163 THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000164 IT IS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000165 THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000166 WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000167 THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000168 THE ALARM CLOCK WAS SET FOR TWENTY PAST THREE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000169 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000170 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000171 THE BOY WENT TO THE WELL EVERY DAY TO MEET WITH FATIMA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000172 IT'S THE NAME OF THE PROPHET'S DAUGHTER FATIMA SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000173 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000174 THE BOY REMEMBERED HIS DREAM AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR TO HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000175 GET SOME WATER QUICKLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000176 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000177 THERE WAS A LOUD SHRIEK FROM A WOMAN STANDING BEHIND US
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000178 THEN LEAVE WITH THE CARAVAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000179 HE IS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND JUST TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000180 YOU'RE STILL A GOOD REPORTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000181 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000182 THERE ISN'T ANY MORE WINE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000183 DOES THIS BELONG TO YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000184 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000185 THEY WANTED TO SAVE THE OASIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000186 TWO HORSEMEN WAITING AHEAD OF THEM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000187 I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000188 I DON'T MUCH LIKE CHANGE HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000189 THE DUNES ARE CHANGED BY THE WIND BUT THE DESERT NEVER CHANGES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000190 SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000191 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000192 HE'S IN MY ROOM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000193 IS SHE AS GOOD AS YOU SAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000194 THEY FILLED THREE SACKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000195 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000196 THIS IS THE MORNING POST YOU'RE TALKING TO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000197 YOU WILL SPEND THAT HOUR GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH MARSHALL BAILEY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000198 THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000199 IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000200 THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000201 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000202 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000203 I KNOW ITS DIMENSIONS AND HOW IT BEHAVES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000204 OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000205 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000206 TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000207 GET DOWN QUICK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000208 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000209 HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HOLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000210 YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000211 IT WAS HARASSMENT PURE AND SIMPLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000212 THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS CAPE AND THE BOY WAS STRUCK BY WHAT HE SAW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000213 HOW WAS THAT FOR A TIGHT SQUEEZE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000214 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000215 WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000216 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000217 GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SEASON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000218 THE DISPLAY WAS UNDERWHELMING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000219 NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FELLOWS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000220 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000221 THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000222 I'M GONNA BUILD AIR FIELDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000223 HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000224 A POX UPON ME FOR A CLUMSY THING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000225 STOVE'S HOTTER THAN I THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000226 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000227 THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000228 IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000229 YOU THINK IT'S EASY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000230 THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000231 I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000232 THE WIRELESS JOYPAD WAS EXPERIENCING CONNECTION ISSUES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000233 AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000234 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000235 IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000236 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000237 THAT'S WHY ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE NICE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000238 THIS IS A TRICK TO GET YOUR SYMPATHY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000239 IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000240 THE SHOP WAS BUSY AND THE MAN ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000241 SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000242 TONIGHT THEY WOULD FIND OUT THE TRUTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000243 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000244 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000245 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000246 HE HAD ASSUMED HE WOULD SOON RETURN TO HIS SHEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000247 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000248 NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000249 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
