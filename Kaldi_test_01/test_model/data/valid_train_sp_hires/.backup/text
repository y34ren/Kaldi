cv-valid-train-sample-000000 LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000001 EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE EVOLVED HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000002 YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000003 SO NOW I FEAR NOTHING BECAUSE IT WAS THOSE OMENS THAT BROUGHT YOU TO ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000004 IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000005 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000006 NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000007 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
cv-valid-train-sample-000008 PUT JACKIE RIGHT ON THE STAFF
cv-valid-train-sample-000009 WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000010 YOU MUST NOT LET UP EVEN AFTER HAVING COME SO FAR HE CONTINUED
cv-valid-train-sample-000011 IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE WAR IS OVER THEN WAIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000012 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000013 BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE AND DIDN'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY
cv-valid-train-sample-000014 AS THEY BEGAN TO DECORATE THE HALLWAY A SILHOUETTE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000015 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000016 HE WAS MY BROTHER
cv-valid-train-sample-000017 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000018 WE'LL PAY ALL YOUR EXPENSES
cv-valid-train-sample-000019 THEN THEY GOT AHOLD OF SOME DOUGH AND WENT GOOFY
cv-valid-train-sample-000020 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000021 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-train-sample-000022 FILL THIS PLACE WITH A SANDSTORM SO STRONG THAT IT BLOTS OUT THE SUN
cv-valid-train-sample-000023 I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000024 I MAKE MY LIVING FORECASTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000025 I DO WANT THAT PLATINUM RING
cv-valid-train-sample-000026 TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT I HAD A RECURRENT DREAM TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000027 DON'T LET THEM SEE THAT YOU'RE AFRAID THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000028 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
cv-valid-train-sample-000029 THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFF AGAIN BUT WHEN I LOOKED OUTSIDE THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000030 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000031 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000032 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000033 THE YEARS OF RESEARCH THE MAGIC SYMBOLS THE STRANGE WORDS AND THE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000034 I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000035 THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
cv-valid-train-sample-000036 ASK THE OWNER OF THAT STALL HOW MUCH THE SWORD COSTS HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND
cv-valid-train-sample-000037 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
cv-valid-train-sample-000038 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY GIVE UP ON IT SO EARLY TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000039 A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000040 THE SNOW BLASTED ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000041 HAVE A GOOD TRIP
cv-valid-train-sample-000042 TRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU'RE IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000043 SEPARATION OF GARBAGE MAKES RECYCLING POSSIBLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000044 THEY WERE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT AND CLAMORED TO HEAR HIS STORIES ABOUT THE GREAT CITIES
cv-valid-train-sample-000045 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
cv-valid-train-sample-000046 THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COMPANY
cv-valid-train-sample-000047 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000048 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
cv-valid-train-sample-000049 SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
cv-valid-train-sample-000050 JUST THE ANT COLONY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000051 SO THE BOY WAS DISAPPOINTED HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN BELIEVE IN DREAMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000052 HOW DO YOU MEAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000053 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT GIRL'S VERY SICK
cv-valid-train-sample-000054 THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000055 THE TRADITION TEACHES MEN HOW TO CROSS THE DESERT AND HOW THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD MARRY
cv-valid-train-sample-000056 I'M EVERYTHING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID I WAS
cv-valid-train-sample-000057 I'M IN A DRUGSTORE
cv-valid-train-sample-000058 IT REQUIRED NO EXPLANATION JUST AS THE UNIVERSE NEEDS NONE AS IT TRAVELS THROUGH ENDLESS TIME
cv-valid-train-sample-000059 FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
cv-valid-train-sample-000060 EVEN IF YOU CLEANED MY CRYSTAL FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000061 MR BRAD CABLES YOU NEED CASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000062 WAIT FOR THE END OF THE WAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000063 HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
cv-valid-train-sample-000064 IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE THE LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000065 YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WITCH DOCTORS HE SPOKE SOME VERSES FROM THE KORAN AND MOVED ON
cv-valid-train-sample-000066 THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
cv-valid-train-sample-000067 IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000068 THE FLOCK OF FLAMINGOS LANDED GRACEFULLY ON THEIR AWKWARD LOOKING LEGS
cv-valid-train-sample-000069 THE BOY WAS SAD AS HE LEFT HER THAT DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000070 SHE WENT OVER TO THE HOSPITAL TO CALL ON PROFESSOR DAVIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000071 THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT HIS DESTINY TO THE END
cv-valid-train-sample-000072 THE CHARCOAL BURNED AWAY TO WHITE ASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000073 THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
cv-valid-train-sample-000074 WHAT IF YOU CAN'T STAND HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000075 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000076 HE DIDN'T NEED TO DEMONSTRATE HIS SCIENCE AND ART TO ANYONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000077 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000078 BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOVE
cv-valid-train-sample-000079 BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000080 WHY DO YOU WANT TO FIND THAT SORT OF PERSON THE ARAB ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000081 THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
cv-valid-train-sample-000082 HOW DO YOU HANDLE THE NEGATIVE WEIGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000083 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
cv-valid-train-sample-000084 AND ALSO BY UNHAPPINESS ENVY AND JEALOUSY
cv-valid-train-sample-000085 TO CALIBRATE THE MOTION CAPTURING SYSTEM PLEASE DO A TPOSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000086 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
cv-valid-train-sample-000087 THE ALCHEMIST FOLLOWED AS THE BOY'S HORSE RAN FOR ALMOST HALF AN HOUR
cv-valid-train-sample-000088 ALL THIS HAPPENED BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNSET THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000089 SHALL I PUT A LITTLE RUM IN THE COFFEE
cv-valid-train-sample-000090 TO NOURISH THE FALCON
cv-valid-train-sample-000091 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000092 WHO IS THIS STRANGER WHO SPEAKS OF OMENS ASKED ONE OF THE CHIEFTAINS EYEING THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000093 HELP MY FRIEND MR RICHARD
cv-valid-train-sample-000094 WANT TO WALK TO NEW YORK
cv-valid-train-sample-000095 DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE
cv-valid-train-sample-000096 I DIDN'T FALL IN
cv-valid-train-sample-000097 IT'S LATE IN THE EVENING A PERFECT TIME FOR COFFEE
cv-valid-train-sample-000098 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000099 THE BOSS SENT ME OVER WITH IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000100 HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
cv-valid-train-sample-000101 THE FUMES FROM THE TRAFFIC WAS UNBEARABLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000102 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
cv-valid-train-sample-000103 THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
cv-valid-train-sample-000104 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000105 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY APPARENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000106 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000107 THE ENGLISHMAN HAD SEVERAL SUITCASES FILLED WITH BOOKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000108 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train-sample-000109 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000110 WISH I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000111 HE STILL CALLS HIS MOTHER MUMMY
cv-valid-train-sample-000112 IT'S COMMON TO RUN INTO PROBLEMS SO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000113 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000114 THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000115 HARRY'LL TEAR HIS DINNER SUIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000116 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000117 YOU'VE GOT HIS GUN
cv-valid-train-sample-000118 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
cv-valid-train-sample-000119 IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT IT MATTERS A LOT
cv-valid-train-sample-000120 WE MUST BE GOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000121 WATCH OVER HER TONIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000122 DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE
cv-valid-train-sample-000123 THERE'S A MOON OUT TONIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000124 THE BOY REPEATED HIS QUESTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000125 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000126 YOU'RE A WEEK LATE FOR SCHOOL ALREADY
cv-valid-train-sample-000127 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
cv-valid-train-sample-000128 YOU HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR DREAMS ABOUT THE OLD KING AND YOUR TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000129 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
cv-valid-train-sample-000130 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000131 THE LEVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
cv-valid-train-sample-000132 WITH THE GIRL WITH THE RAVEN HAIR HIS DAYS WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000133 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
cv-valid-train-sample-000134 WEAR THE BLUE ONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000135 LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOURLEAF CLOVERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000136 I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000137 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000138 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000139 THE TWO WALKED OUT AMONG THE PALMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000140 HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000141 THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000142 MEN HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS OF THE WISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000143 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000144 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000145 GET THE BULLETIN BOARD
cv-valid-train-sample-000146 THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000147 YOU TOLD ME THAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000148 NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
cv-valid-train-sample-000149 DO YOU WANT TO WAKE THAT BABY
cv-valid-train-sample-000150 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000151 I NEVER STOLE A WATCH IN MY LIFE
cv-valid-train-sample-000152 GOOD LUCK TO YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000153 MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000154 I WAS JUST ASKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000155 LET HIM HAVE EVERYTHING HE WANTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000156 THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000157 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000158 EGYPT IS A COUNTRY THAT IS OFTEN MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000159 HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
cv-valid-train-sample-000160 THE BOY KNEW AND WAS NOW WORKING TOWARD IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000161 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000162 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000163 THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
cv-valid-train-sample-000164 IT IS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000165 THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
cv-valid-train-sample-000166 WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
cv-valid-train-sample-000167 THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
cv-valid-train-sample-000168 THE ALARM CLOCK WAS SET FOR TWENTY PAST THREE
cv-valid-train-sample-000169 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000170 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000171 THE BOY WENT TO THE WELL EVERY DAY TO MEET WITH FATIMA
cv-valid-train-sample-000172 IT'S THE NAME OF THE PROPHET'S DAUGHTER FATIMA SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000173 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000174 THE BOY REMEMBERED HIS DREAM AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR TO HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000175 GET SOME WATER QUICKLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000176 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
cv-valid-train-sample-000177 THERE WAS A LOUD SHRIEK FROM A WOMAN STANDING BEHIND US
cv-valid-train-sample-000178 THEN LEAVE WITH THE CARAVAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000179 HE IS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND JUST TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000180 YOU'RE STILL A GOOD REPORTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000181 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000182 THERE ISN'T ANY MORE WINE
cv-valid-train-sample-000183 DOES THIS BELONG TO YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000184 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000185 THEY WANTED TO SAVE THE OASIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000186 TWO HORSEMEN WAITING AHEAD OF THEM
cv-valid-train-sample-000187 I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000188 I DON'T MUCH LIKE CHANGE HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000189 THE DUNES ARE CHANGED BY THE WIND BUT THE DESERT NEVER CHANGES
cv-valid-train-sample-000190 SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS
cv-valid-train-sample-000191 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000192 HE'S IN MY ROOM
cv-valid-train-sample-000193 IS SHE AS GOOD AS YOU SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000194 THEY FILLED THREE SACKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000195 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000196 THIS IS THE MORNING POST YOU'RE TALKING TO
cv-valid-train-sample-000197 YOU WILL SPEND THAT HOUR GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH MARSHALL BAILEY
cv-valid-train-sample-000198 THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000199 IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
cv-valid-train-sample-000200 THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000201 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000202 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000203 I KNOW ITS DIMENSIONS AND HOW IT BEHAVES
cv-valid-train-sample-000204 OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT
cv-valid-train-sample-000205 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000206 TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000207 GET DOWN QUICK
cv-valid-train-sample-000208 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000209 HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HOLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000210 YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
cv-valid-train-sample-000211 IT WAS HARASSMENT PURE AND SIMPLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000212 THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS CAPE AND THE BOY WAS STRUCK BY WHAT HE SAW
cv-valid-train-sample-000213 HOW WAS THAT FOR A TIGHT SQUEEZE
cv-valid-train-sample-000214 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
cv-valid-train-sample-000215 WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000216 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000217 GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SEASON
cv-valid-train-sample-000218 THE DISPLAY WAS UNDERWHELMING
cv-valid-train-sample-000219 NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FELLOWS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
cv-valid-train-sample-000220 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000221 THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000222 I'M GONNA BUILD AIR FIELDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000223 HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000224 A POX UPON ME FOR A CLUMSY THING
cv-valid-train-sample-000225 STOVE'S HOTTER THAN I THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000226 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000227 THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF
cv-valid-train-sample-000228 IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
cv-valid-train-sample-000229 YOU THINK IT'S EASY
cv-valid-train-sample-000230 THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
cv-valid-train-sample-000231 I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000232 THE WIRELESS JOYPAD WAS EXPERIENCING CONNECTION ISSUES
cv-valid-train-sample-000233 AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000234 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000235 IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000236 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000237 THAT'S WHY ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE NICE
cv-valid-train-sample-000238 THIS IS A TRICK TO GET YOUR SYMPATHY
cv-valid-train-sample-000239 IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000240 THE SHOP WAS BUSY AND THE MAN ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON
cv-valid-train-sample-000241 SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000242 TONIGHT THEY WOULD FIND OUT THE TRUTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000243 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
cv-valid-train-sample-000244 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000245 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000246 HE HAD ASSUMED HE WOULD SOON RETURN TO HIS SHEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000247 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
cv-valid-train-sample-000248 NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000249 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000250 HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000251 I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000252 THIS IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION SHELDON SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000253 I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
cv-valid-train-sample-000254 IT ALL HAPPENED RATHER SUDDENLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000255 SURE SEE YOU THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000256 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train-sample-000257 A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK
cv-valid-train-sample-000258 HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
cv-valid-train-sample-000259 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000260 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
cv-valid-train-sample-000261 PATRICK HAS TERMINAL CANCER
cv-valid-train-sample-000262 THIS IS JON DAVIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000263 THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000264 ONE AFTERNOON ONE OF HIS SERVANTS FELL ILL AND IT APPEARED THAT HE WOULD DIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000265 ACCORDING TO THE PREDOMINANT NOTION IN THE VATICAN CONDOMS SHOULDN'T BE USED IN SPITE OF HIV
cv-valid-train-sample-000266 BUT YOU ARE FORCING ME TO LOOK AT WEALTH AND AT HORIZONS I HAVE NEVER KNOWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000267 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
cv-valid-train-sample-000268 HE PAID FOR THE WOOL AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000269 THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000270 AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000271 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
cv-valid-train-sample-000272 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000273 I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
cv-valid-train-sample-000274 I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000275 MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY
cv-valid-train-sample-000276 ARABS OFTEN APPEARED IN THE CITY SHOPPING AND CHANTING THEIR STRANGE PRAYERS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000277 THERE IS A REPTILE IN MY WESTERN SHOES
cv-valid-train-sample-000278 HOW ARE YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000279 I WANT TO STAY AT THE OASIS THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000280 AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
cv-valid-train-sample-000281 WHAT'S IN THAT DESK
cv-valid-train-sample-000282 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000283 I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000284 THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000285 SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
cv-valid-train-sample-000286 DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AT AN ABANDONED CHURCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000287 EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000288 BECAUSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WOULD FIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000289 IN HIS HEART HE WANTED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO SLEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000290 THE BOY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000291 THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000292 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000293 WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000294 THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000295 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
cv-valid-train-sample-000296 THE BOY SWORE THAT EVERY TIME HE HEARD THE ALARM HE WOULD HEED ITS MESSAGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000297 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
cv-valid-train-sample-000298 I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000299 WE CAN ONLY PERCEIVE A PART OF THE BROAD LIGHT SPECTRUM THE SUN EMITS
cv-valid-train-sample-000300 THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON
cv-valid-train-sample-000301 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000302 FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
cv-valid-train-sample-000303 I DON'T KNOW YOU FROM ADAM
cv-valid-train-sample-000304 THEY WERE RACING DOWN THE STREETS WITH NO REGARD FOR ANYONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000305 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000306 IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
cv-valid-train-sample-000307 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
cv-valid-train-sample-000308 THERESA COULDN'T FEEL ANY MORE DUMB RIGHT NOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000309 HE'S ALLERGIC TO HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000310 I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET SOME STYLISH UNDERWEAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000311 THIRTY EVERY THURSDAY SIXTY AT SIXTY WHO KNOWS WHAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000312 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000313 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
cv-valid-train-sample-000314 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000315 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000316 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000317 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000318 THERE'S A LOT MORE YOU CAN DO WITH A TIGHTER INTEGRATION WITH THE EYE TRACKING API
cv-valid-train-sample-000319 HE KNEW WHAT I WAS THINKING THE BOY SAID TO HIMSELF
cv-valid-train-sample-000320 WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO WRITE ABOUT HILLARY
cv-valid-train-sample-000321 HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000322 JOHNATHAN ASSESSED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000323 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
cv-valid-train-sample-000324 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000325 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000326 HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THE STRANGE LAND HE WAS IN
cv-valid-train-sample-000327 FROM THAT DAY ON IT WAS THE DESERT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT
cv-valid-train-sample-000328 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
cv-valid-train-sample-000329 AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE MAN LIVED
cv-valid-train-sample-000330 IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
cv-valid-train-sample-000331 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000332 IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELED BY FIREWOOD WITH A TRANSPARENT FLASK HEATING ON TOP
cv-valid-train-sample-000333 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000334 SO IMMERSE YOURSELF IN IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000335 WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000336 BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
cv-valid-train-sample-000337 HIS NAME IS WELCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000338 THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000339 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train-sample-000340 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
cv-valid-train-sample-000341 THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
cv-valid-train-sample-000342 THE MAN LOOKED AT THE ANGEL IN SURPRISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000343 BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000344 THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MORE TEA
cv-valid-train-sample-000345 THAT WAS HIS WORK
cv-valid-train-sample-000346 WHAT YOUR HUSBAND WAS MIXED UP IN
cv-valid-train-sample-000347 THE BOY RECALLED THE BRILLIANCE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000348 IF I'M ON THE MARCH I JUST CONCENTRATE ON MARCHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000349 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000350 THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000351 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000352 IT'S THE ONLY ONE THEY HAD LEFT
cv-valid-train-sample-000353 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000354 HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000355 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
cv-valid-train-sample-000356 THERE WAS NO OTHER BAGGAGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000357 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
cv-valid-train-sample-000358 DID YOU SAY A KING HE ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000359 WHAT HE SAID REMINDED THE BOY OF THE OLD KING
cv-valid-train-sample-000360 BUT WE COULD SELL TEA IN CRYSTAL GLASSES
cv-valid-train-sample-000361 HE WAS THINKING ABOUT OMENS AND SOMEONE HAD APPEARED
cv-valid-train-sample-000362 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
cv-valid-train-sample-000363 IN THE DISCOTHEQUE THE DJ PLAYED PROGRESSIVE HOUSE MUSIC AND TRANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000364 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
cv-valid-train-sample-000365 I'VE WATCHED YOU GROW UP FROM A LITTLE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000366 IT'S THE ONLY NAME I'VE GOT
cv-valid-train-sample-000367 THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
cv-valid-train-sample-000368 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000369 I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS
cv-valid-train-sample-000370 IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE
cv-valid-train-sample-000371 THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000372 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000373 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000374 BUT AS TIME PASSED TANGIER HAD CHANGED
cv-valid-train-sample-000375 MY KEYCHAIN IS HEAVY AND AWKWARD TO CARRY IN MY POCKET
cv-valid-train-sample-000376 I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000377 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
cv-valid-train-sample-000378 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000379 I KNOW THAT GIRL
cv-valid-train-sample-000380 HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000381 BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000382 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000383 LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
cv-valid-train-sample-000384 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000385 HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000386 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000387 HOW COULD HE BE A FAKE
cv-valid-train-sample-000388 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
cv-valid-train-sample-000389 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
cv-valid-train-sample-000390 ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
cv-valid-train-sample-000391 I FEEL LIKE A BOOTLEGGER
cv-valid-train-sample-000392 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
cv-valid-train-sample-000393 THEN GET OUT OF HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000394 THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
cv-valid-train-sample-000395 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000396 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000397 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
cv-valid-train-sample-000398 YOU ALL KNOW ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000399 WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PLODDING THROUGH SOME USER INTERVIEWS AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000400 I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THAT TUB
cv-valid-train-sample-000401 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000402 THIS DESERT WAS ONCE A SEA HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000403 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000404 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000405 HE HAD NO IDEA HOW HE WAS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000406 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
cv-valid-train-sample-000407 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000408 THAT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000409 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000410 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
cv-valid-train-sample-000411 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
cv-valid-train-sample-000412 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000413 SHE JOINED UP TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000414 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000415 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
cv-valid-train-sample-000416 THERE'S LIFE HERE THE BOY SAID TO THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000417 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
cv-valid-train-sample-000418 I'M GOING TO THEM
cv-valid-train-sample-000419 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000420 IT BELONGS TO ME NOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000421 HAS HE BEEN HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000422 BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
cv-valid-train-sample-000423 YOU SAID YOU WANTED FIREWORKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000424 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
cv-valid-train-sample-000425 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
cv-valid-train-sample-000426 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train-sample-000427 I WISH THEY WERE TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000428 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
cv-valid-train-sample-000429 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
cv-valid-train-sample-000430 THEY WERE ALWAYS JUST SOMEBODY TO FILL UP THE BLEACHERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000431 DONT FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE IT WOULD NOT HELP
cv-valid-train-sample-000432 THERE WAS A SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE STATUE
cv-valid-train-sample-000433 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000434 HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000435 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000436 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000437 NOBODY'S TRYING TO STEAL FROM YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000438 BUT HE FOUND IT MUCH MORE INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THE CARAVAN AND LISTEN TO THE WIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000439 IT CONSIDERS THE HORIZONTAL DIMENSION AS TIME
cv-valid-train-sample-000440 HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED
cv-valid-train-sample-000441 ALWAYS HEED THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000442 IT COMMENCED TO BLOW HARDER RAISING THE DESERT SANDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000443 WELL WHAT GOOD WOULD IT BE TO YOU IF YOU HAD T DIE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000444 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000445 CAROL SAVED HER BROTHER'S LIFE THAT DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000446 IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000447 THAT HE HAD ATTENDED A SEMINARY UNTIL HE WAS SIXTEEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000448 I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000449 KEEP HIM IN HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000450 MAYBE TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER THAN YESTERDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000451 SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALEX PRETTY WELL
cv-valid-train-sample-000452 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000453 WHEN THE SIMUM CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000454 THE FOREST BURNED FOR THIRTEEN DAYS
cv-valid-train-sample-000455 WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000456 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
cv-valid-train-sample-000457 HE WASHED THE DETRITUS FROM HIS HAIR
cv-valid-train-sample-000458 THAT'S WHAT ALCHEMISTS DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000459 HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000460 THE RESTAURANT WAS QUITE EXPENSIVE
cv-valid-train-sample-000461 PHONE THE NEWSPAPERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000462 HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
cv-valid-train-sample-000463 HE AROSE AND TAKING UP HIS CROOK BEGAN TO AWAKEN THE SHEEP THAT STILL SLEPT
cv-valid-train-sample-000464 THE SHEPHERD SWORE THAT HE WOULD
cv-valid-train-sample-000465 AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000466 MAKTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000467 I DIDN'T FRISK HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000468 HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000469 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
cv-valid-train-sample-000470 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
cv-valid-train-sample-000471 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000472 I'M LEAVING TODAY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000473 THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000474 I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000475 AND TOMORROW HIS ENEMY WOULD ALSO BE A PART OF THAT SOUL
cv-valid-train-sample-000476 I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000477 SO THEN TRY HE SAID TO THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000478 I DON'T BELIEVE IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000479 THE VIRUS SPREAD FASTER THAN WILDFIRE
cv-valid-train-sample-000480 THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000481 I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000482 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000483 PERHAPS SHE MET SOMEBODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000484 TAKE YOUR PAWS OFF ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000485 APPLE PIE IS AN ICONIC DISH
cv-valid-train-sample-000486 AM I GOING TO FIND MY TREASURE HE ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000487 THE ACHIEVED RESULTS ARE FAR BEHIND THE STATEOFTHEART IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000488 THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
cv-valid-train-sample-000489 COACH HAS HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000490 THE SUN WAS TURNED INTO A GOLDEN DISK
cv-valid-train-sample-000491 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000492 THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
cv-valid-train-sample-000493 AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000494 IF HE ABANDONS THAT PURSUIT IT'S BECAUSE IT WASN'T TRUELOVE
cv-valid-train-sample-000495 THE OASIS IS NEUTRAL GROUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000496 WHAT DO YOU SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000497 I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000498 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
cv-valid-train-sample-000499 SURE I KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES
cv-valid-train-sample-000500 HE'S THE MAN THE ADS ARE WRITTEN FOR
cv-valid-train-sample-000501 AND ABOVE ALL DON'T FORGET TO FOLLOW YOUR DESTINY THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION
cv-valid-train-sample-000502 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000503 I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT
cv-valid-train-sample-000504 WE WANT SOME ACTION IN THESE PICTURES
cv-valid-train-sample-000505 SYMBOLS OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000506 THIS GUY STOLE MY WATCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000507 IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WINE HE HAD EVER TASTED
cv-valid-train-sample-000508 IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000509 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
cv-valid-train-sample-000510 THE SPACE WAS SPARTAN ALMOST BARE
cv-valid-train-sample-000511 DO YOU MIND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE CROWDED
cv-valid-train-sample-000512 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000513 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
cv-valid-train-sample-000514 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000515 HE'S THE ONLY HUSBAND I'VE GOT
cv-valid-train-sample-000516 THIS IS FOR YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000517 THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000518 HE NEVER ASKED ME TO SIT DOWN IN HIS LIFE
cv-valid-train-sample-000519 MY NAME'S PETE DAVIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000520 PRETTY NICE NECK YOU'VE GOT THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000521 AN ARMY IS COMING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000522 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
cv-valid-train-sample-000523 YOU MEAN HERE IN THE CITY
cv-valid-train-sample-000524 REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOUR HEART IS THERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000525 REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOUR HEART IS THERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000526 I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000527 THE BOY APPROACHED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000528 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
cv-valid-train-sample-000529 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000530 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000531 HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
cv-valid-train-sample-000532 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000533 THE BOY FELT ILL AND TERRIBLY ALONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000534 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train-sample-000535 WILL YOU EXCUSE US A MINUTE
cv-valid-train-sample-000536 I'M LOVING IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000537 AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
cv-valid-train-sample-000538 YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000539 YOUR HEART IS ALIVE
cv-valid-train-sample-000540 PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS VILLAGE SON SAID HIS FATHER
cv-valid-train-sample-000541 AND THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY WELL
cv-valid-train-sample-000542 VICTORIA DOES THINGS IN A MUCH BIGGER WAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000543 I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000544 I'D HATE TO HAVE THAT MANY PINS STUCK IN ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000545 BUT WHAT'S ALL THIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000546 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000547 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000548 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000549 HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000550 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000551 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000552 WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000553 HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
cv-valid-train-sample-000554 DOESNT IT DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF HASHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000555 AND THAT HE A BOY COULD PERFORM MIRACLES
cv-valid-train-sample-000556 IT WON'T HURT YOU AND WE CAN MAKE THE CITY EDITION
cv-valid-train-sample-000557 THE NAVY'S GOING TO FLY FATHER HOME THIS AFTERNOON
cv-valid-train-sample-000558 HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000559 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000560 WE ATE SPICY RICE WITH CHICKEN LEGS AND WHITE MUSHROOMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000561 THE HEAT LASTED UNTIL NIGHTFALL AND ALL THAT TIME HE HAD TO CARRY HIS JACKET
cv-valid-train-sample-000562 AND I'LL SIGN A PAPER
cv-valid-train-sample-000563 THAT'S AN INHERENT DISADVANTAGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000564 I'D BETTER HUSTLE HIM UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000565 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000566 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
cv-valid-train-sample-000567 I'M AFRAID SHE'D FEEL ASHAMED TO THINK SHE HADN'T TRUSTED YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000568 BUT I'M GOING TO EGYPT THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000569 WHAT WERE YOU WHEN YOU CAME HERE FIVE YEARS AGO
cv-valid-train-sample-000570 I GOT IT BACK
cv-valid-train-sample-000571 I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
cv-valid-train-sample-000572 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
cv-valid-train-sample-000573 FASTFOOD IS CONVENIENT BUT OFTEN UNHEALTHY
cv-valid-train-sample-000574 HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE MORNING'S MEETING
cv-valid-train-sample-000575 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
cv-valid-train-sample-000576 THE NEARBY CITY OF CEUTA HAD GROWN FASTER THAN TANGIER AND BUSINESS HAD FALLEN OFF
cv-valid-train-sample-000577 HE'S DEPOSITED TEN DOLLARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000578 ONLY US EXPLORERS CAN GET IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000579 JUST A MEMORY RIGHT NOW IT SIGNIFIED SHADE WATER AND A REFUGE FROM THE WAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000580 THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
cv-valid-train-sample-000581 DIDN'T I TELL YOU NEVER TO COME PANHANDLING AROUND HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000582 THIS WILL HELP YOU EFFECTIVELY COLLABORATE WITH DEVELOPERS AND COORDINATE CROSSTEAM PROJECTS THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER
cv-valid-train-sample-000583 BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000584 BUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT HAD NO CHOICE
cv-valid-train-sample-000585 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000586 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
cv-valid-train-sample-000587 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000588 THE MAN WEPT WITH HAPPINESS
cv-valid-train-sample-000589 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
cv-valid-train-sample-000590 COME IN AGAIN SOME TIME
cv-valid-train-sample-000591 RAISINS ARE DELICIOUS
cv-valid-train-sample-000592 HE WANTED YOUR MONEY HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000593 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000594 MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000595 YOU MUSTN'T LET WHAT SHE SAID BOTHER YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000596 SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME THE SUN ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000597 HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU GET
cv-valid-train-sample-000598 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
cv-valid-train-sample-000599 HOW DO I GUESS AT THE FUTURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000600 LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
cv-valid-train-sample-000601 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000602 DON'T MIND THE COLONEL
cv-valid-train-sample-000603 HE THOUGHT OF ALL THE MARRIED SHEPHERDS HE HAD KNOWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000604 I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT
cv-valid-train-sample-000605 AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000606 WHAT IS A FOREIGNER DOING HERE ASKED ANOTHER OF THE MEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000607 AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000608 THERE'S THAT REPRIEVE IF THEY EVER FIND OUT
cv-valid-train-sample-000609 THREE DAYS FROM NOW HE WOULD BE WITH THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000610 IF YOU DON'T STOP FOLLOWING ME I'LL CALL THE POLICE
cv-valid-train-sample-000611 BUT MAYBE PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT WAY HAD NEVER LEARNED THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000612 BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
cv-valid-train-sample-000613 LOOKS LIKE ABOUT TEN YEARS A PIECE FOR YOU BIRDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000614 HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
cv-valid-train-sample-000615 THE OTHER SON WAS A POET AND DELIGHTED ALL OF ROME WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL VERSES
cv-valid-train-sample-000616 HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000617 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000618 ONE MUST PREPARE FOR IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000619 BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUMNI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000620 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000621 IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
cv-valid-train-sample-000622 A MAN DOESN'T GET IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS EVERY DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000623 CAN I GET A WOOT WOOT
cv-valid-train-sample-000624 I THINK IT'S ABOUT BIRD HUNTING BUT NOW I CAN SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED
cv-valid-train-sample-000625 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000626 SUNBURNS CAN BE AVOIDED BY APPLYING SUNSCREEN OR BY STAYING IN THE SHADOWS
cv-valid-train-sample-000627 IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000628 IF HE EVER DECIDED TO LEAVE THEM THEY WOULD SUFFER
cv-valid-train-sample-000629 TAKE CHARGE OF HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000630 I LOST MY WALLET
cv-valid-train-sample-000631 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
cv-valid-train-sample-000632 HE'S NUTS ABOUT YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000633 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
cv-valid-train-sample-000634 I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRANSMITTED BY WORD OF MOUTH HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000635 IT'S THE OTHER FOREIGNER THE ENGLISHMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000636 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000637 THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOSED OFF THE CONVERSATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000638 YOU'LL NEVER GET IT OUT OF ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000639 IT WAS THE PURE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000640 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000641 I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY
cv-valid-train-sample-000642 I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CHANGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000643 IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000644 THEY WENT TO THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE MONASTERY
cv-valid-train-sample-000645 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000646 IF WHAT ONE FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTER IT WILL NEVER SPOIL
cv-valid-train-sample-000647 WILL I LEARN TO DO THAT SOMEDAY THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000648 THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
cv-valid-train-sample-000649 HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
cv-valid-train-sample-000650 BY THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION I SAW THEM STAGGERING AND FALLING AND THEIR SUPPORTERS TURNING TO RUN
cv-valid-train-sample-000651 AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000652 IT HAD TOLD HIM TO DIG WHERE HIS TEARS FELL
cv-valid-train-sample-000653 HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-train-sample-000654 MOHAMMED IS A WONDERFUL GUITAR PLAYER
cv-valid-train-sample-000655 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000656 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000657 A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000658 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000659 LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000660 THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
cv-valid-train-sample-000661 AND HE KNEW WHAT WAS THE FAIR PRICE FOR EVERY ONE OF HIS ANIMALS
cv-valid-train-sample-000662 MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000663 MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000664 THEY'RE CALLING TO US NOT TO GIVE UP AND TO KEEP ON FIGHTING
cv-valid-train-sample-000665 IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY
cv-valid-train-sample-000666 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
cv-valid-train-sample-000667 OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000668 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
cv-valid-train-sample-000669 I'M GOING TO THEM
cv-valid-train-sample-000670 I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000671 SUNBURNS CAN BE AVOIDED BY APPLYING SUNSCREEN OR BY STAYING IN THE SHADOWS
cv-valid-train-sample-000672 THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000673 AND THE LAST ONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000674 A LOT OF MONEY
cv-valid-train-sample-000675 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
cv-valid-train-sample-000676 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000677 I SAID I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN
cv-valid-train-sample-000678 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000679 I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000680 ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE EVERY LIE HE TELLS YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000681 THERE WAS A HOLE THERE AMONG THE STONES
cv-valid-train-sample-000682 LICORICE IS A BLACK CHEWY FOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000683 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000684 THE SHEEP FIDGETED NEARBY UNEASY WITH THEIR NEW OWNER AND EXCITED BY SO MUCH CHANGE
cv-valid-train-sample-000685 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000686 HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
cv-valid-train-sample-000687 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000688 THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000689 I DIDN'T COME HERE TO HAVE YOU READ MY PALM HE SAID ALREADY REGRETTING HAVING COME
cv-valid-train-sample-000690 I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT MY HORIZON HAS EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000691 IT SORT OF MAKES A FELLOW LOSE FAITH IN HIMSELF
cv-valid-train-sample-000692 THOSE GYPSIES ARE REALLY SMART HE THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000693 DO I LOOK AS FUNNY AS YOU DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000694 BUT I'M LIABLE TO GET INTO A JAM
cv-valid-train-sample-000695 ALL THE VILLAGERS CHEERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000696 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000697 THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
cv-valid-train-sample-000698 THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
cv-valid-train-sample-000699 YOU BROUGHT A NEW FEELING INTO MY CRYSTAL SHOP
cv-valid-train-sample-000700 THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
cv-valid-train-sample-000701 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000702 BECAUSE HE WAS TERRIFIED THE BOY DIDN'T ANSWER
cv-valid-train-sample-000703 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000704 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
cv-valid-train-sample-000705 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000706 IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
cv-valid-train-sample-000707 WHAT GOOD IS MONEY TO YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000708 THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
cv-valid-train-sample-000709 SORT OF A JACK LONDON STYLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000710 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000711 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000712 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000713 BUT HE GRANTED THE TRAVELERS THREE DAYS
cv-valid-train-sample-000714 WELL THEN HELP ME DO THAT THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000715 I AM HERE THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000716 THE ARROW WAS POINTING TO THE EXIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000717 I'M GOING TO GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE DESERT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000718 DO YOU SEE THIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000719 THEY WERE TRIBESMEN DRESSED IN BLUE WITH BLACK RINGS SURROUNDING THEIR TURBANS
cv-valid-train-sample-000720 THE LIBRARY IS OPEN TO EVERYONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000721 THAT'S COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES
cv-valid-train-sample-000722 IT WAS A TENT LIKE MANY AT THE OASIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000723 HE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE PRACTICAL MATTERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000724 SHE WROTE THE STUFF
cv-valid-train-sample-000725 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000726 THE HOOKAHS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUARDS STOOD AT ATTENTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000727 ANOTHER WHO WAS SEARCHING THE BOY'S BAGS FOUND THE PIECE OF GOLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000728 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000729 I NEVER SAW AMANDA ACT LIKE THAT BEFORE
cv-valid-train-sample-000730 THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO COOL
cv-valid-train-sample-000731 OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000732 FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000733 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000734 BECAUSE NOW HE KNEW WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS
cv-valid-train-sample-000735 DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET HIDING PLACE HERE IN THE HOUSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000736 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000737 I'M GOING TO NEED IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000738 I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP
cv-valid-train-sample-000739 I BET YOU FORGOT THE WINE
cv-valid-train-sample-000740 NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
cv-valid-train-sample-000741 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train-sample-000742 THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000743 AS HE WAS LEAVING HE SAW IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM HIS OLD SHEPHERD'S POUCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000744 IS THERE A MRS JOSHUA
cv-valid-train-sample-000745 I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000746 YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
cv-valid-train-sample-000747 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
cv-valid-train-sample-000748 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
cv-valid-train-sample-000749 THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000750 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000751 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
cv-valid-train-sample-000752 THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED
cv-valid-train-sample-000753 WHAT TRICKS WOULD I PULL
cv-valid-train-sample-000754 THIS SOLUTION ALSO WORKS WELL IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL A LINUX DISTRO ON WINDOWS VIA VIRTUALIZATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000755 BECAUSE FOR HIM YOU ARE A GREEN FIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME
cv-valid-train-sample-000756 DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000757 IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000758 BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
cv-valid-train-sample-000759 FEBRUARY TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES
cv-valid-train-sample-000760 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000761 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000762 THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
cv-valid-train-sample-000763 UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000764 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
cv-valid-train-sample-000765 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ROMANTIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000766 THE FOOTBALL JOCKS LAUGHED VICIOUSLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000767 YOU'RE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000768 THE ELEVATORS ARE STILL RUNNING
cv-valid-train-sample-000769 BUT USE THEM TO BUY YOUR FLOCK
cv-valid-train-sample-000770 THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
cv-valid-train-sample-000771 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000772 BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM
cv-valid-train-sample-000773 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000774 THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
cv-valid-train-sample-000775 HAVE YOU GOT A MIRROR
cv-valid-train-sample-000776 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000777 THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000778 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000779 THE PILOTS BRACED THEMSELVES FOR IMPACT
cv-valid-train-sample-000780 IT WAS A A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
cv-valid-train-sample-000781 LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000782 HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
cv-valid-train-sample-000783 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
cv-valid-train-sample-000784 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
cv-valid-train-sample-000785 HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000786 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
cv-valid-train-sample-000787 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
cv-valid-train-sample-000788 I CAN EXPLAIN IF YOU'LL JUST LISTEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000789 THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
cv-valid-train-sample-000790 IT'S NOT A LIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000791 IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
cv-valid-train-sample-000792 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000793 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000794 NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000795 HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000796 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000797 JUST AS A RULE OF THUMB
cv-valid-train-sample-000798 I REALLY DID IT QUITE BRILLIANTLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000799 AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000800 GET ME WALTER BURNS
cv-valid-train-sample-000801 HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF
cv-valid-train-sample-000802 PEOPLE CONTINUED TO COME AND GO FROM THE BAKER'S SHOP
cv-valid-train-sample-000803 THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
cv-valid-train-sample-000804 YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000805 WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
cv-valid-train-sample-000806 FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000807 I WISH YOU'D FORGET ABOUT US
cv-valid-train-sample-000808 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000809 THE BOOK THAT MOST INTERESTED THE BOY TOLD THE STORIES OF THE FAMOUS ALCHEMISTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000810 ARE YOU CRAZY THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON
cv-valid-train-sample-000811 THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING
cv-valid-train-sample-000812 MY ALLERGY HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE TODAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000813 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING AND LOAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000814 BEEN SEEING ME IN YOUR DREAMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000815 THE STRANGER WITHDREW THE SWORD FROM THE BOY'S FOREHEAD AND THE BOY FELT IMMENSELY RELIEVED
cv-valid-train-sample-000816 SHE NEVER GREW UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000817 THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
cv-valid-train-sample-000818 FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
cv-valid-train-sample-000819 MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000820 SAME WAY YOU DID
cv-valid-train-sample-000821 THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000822 WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000823 AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
cv-valid-train-sample-000824 I WANT THOSE STAMPS
cv-valid-train-sample-000825 I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000826 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
cv-valid-train-sample-000827 THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000828 MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
cv-valid-train-sample-000829 BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train-sample-000830 YOU WILL NEVER REOPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000831 YOU DONT COMPARE DIRECTLY TO EXISTING STATEOFTHEART METHODS
cv-valid-train-sample-000832 BUT HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DESIRE THAT AN ARMY INVADE THE OASIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000833 I'M SMOKING TOO MUCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000834 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000835 AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000836 THE TEA SEEMED LESS BITTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000837 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000838 NOT TO WORRY SAID THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000839 EARLIER THIS YEAR WE FOUND A REALLY NICE PLACE NEAR MY OFFICE AND WE MOVED IN TOGETHER
cv-valid-train-sample-000840 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train-sample-000841 THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000842 WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000843 TWO DAYS AGO YOU SAID THAT I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TRAVEL THE MERCHANT ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000844 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000845 HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS WERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000846 MECCA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000847 THAT NIGHT HE TOLD ALL OF THIS TO THE ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000848 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000849 FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000850 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000851 THE ALCHEMIST ERASED THE CIRCLE IN THE SAND AND THE SNAKE SLITHERED AWAY AMONG THE ROCKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000852 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000853 I'M AFRAID THE JOKE'S ON US
cv-valid-train-sample-000854 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000855 THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
cv-valid-train-sample-000856 THE BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS A SURPRISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000857 THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000858 YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000859 AND WHAT A WAY TO QUIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000860 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000861 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000862 AND STOP THREATENING THAT BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000863 THEN HE TURNED TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000864 FOR USERS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY CAN TRUST THEIR OPERATING SYSTEM
cv-valid-train-sample-000865 WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO TO MECCA NOW ASKED THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000866 THE MONK WAS IRRITATED
cv-valid-train-sample-000867 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000868 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000869 CAN'T YOU READ ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000870 ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000871 DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000872 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000873 THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000874 HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
cv-valid-train-sample-000875 WILL YOU GIVE ME THOSE STAMPS
cv-valid-train-sample-000876 I LEFT HER HANGING AROUND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS
cv-valid-train-sample-000877 HE HAD BEEN TO THE VILLAGE ONLY ONCE THE YEAR BEFORE
cv-valid-train-sample-000878 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000879 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000880 WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000881 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
cv-valid-train-sample-000882 LOOK AT THOSE SHOULDERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000883 THE SUN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE
cv-valid-train-sample-000884 SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000885 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000886 I WILL BE BACK SOON
cv-valid-train-sample-000887 WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000888 MRS SARAH DOESN'T EITHER
cv-valid-train-sample-000889 WELLI DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000890 HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000891 I THOUGHT YOU WERE CHASING ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000892 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
cv-valid-train-sample-000893 NOTE THAT IT DOES HAVE BUILTIN SUPPORT FOR WEB BROWSING ALTHOUGH I FIND IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL
cv-valid-train-sample-000894 THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
cv-valid-train-sample-000895 THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT SORTS OF FUEL AT THIS GAS STATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000896 I GOTTA FIGURE SOME WAY OUT OF THIS THING
cv-valid-train-sample-000897 IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000898 THIS BEHAVIOR OF NEURAL NETWORKS IS SOMETIMES CALLED DREAMING
cv-valid-train-sample-000899 DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON
cv-valid-train-sample-000900 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
cv-valid-train-sample-000901 THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION
cv-valid-train-sample-000902 THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000903 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
cv-valid-train-sample-000904 ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
cv-valid-train-sample-000905 I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE HIM SINCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000906 I'M AFRAID I MIGHT HAVE SOILED THE COUCH A LITTLE WITH MY SHOES EDDIE MURPHY
cv-valid-train-sample-000907 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
cv-valid-train-sample-000908 THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SO DID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000909 WHO TOLD YOU THAT ASKED THE BOY STARTLED
cv-valid-train-sample-000910 HE DECIDED TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000911 MY FATHER OFFERED HER A JOB
cv-valid-train-sample-000912 IT WAS PAPA THAT SENDS YOU FLOWERS EVERY DAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000913 ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000914 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
cv-valid-train-sample-000915 I JUMPED IN TO SAVE RACHEL
cv-valid-train-sample-000916 THAT'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000917 IS THE HEAD BETTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000918 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
cv-valid-train-sample-000919 THAT WOMAN IS GONNA BE ON THAT ROOF
cv-valid-train-sample-000920 I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
cv-valid-train-sample-000921 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000922 HE RECITED AN OUR FATHER SILENTLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000923 THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
cv-valid-train-sample-000924 AND HERE'S A KISS FOR YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000925 WHO WROTE THAT SPEECH FOR YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000926 SAVE THAT FOR THE TRIBUNE
cv-valid-train-sample-000927 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
cv-valid-train-sample-000928 SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
cv-valid-train-sample-000929 I DON'T LIKE SEALS ANYHOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000930 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000931 AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP
cv-valid-train-sample-000932 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO LEARN
cv-valid-train-sample-000933 YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000934 THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
cv-valid-train-sample-000935 THE SHIP APPEARED TO BE CONSTRUCTED WITH SOME FORM OF CHROMIUM EXOSKELETON
cv-valid-train-sample-000936 NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECKPOINTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000937 IT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT GUARANTEES EVERYONE'S FREEDOM
cv-valid-train-sample-000938 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000939 A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000940 MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
cv-valid-train-sample-000941 YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAY DIE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000942 THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000943 THEN A MAN APPROACHED
cv-valid-train-sample-000944 BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
cv-valid-train-sample-000945 AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
cv-valid-train-sample-000946 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY ALWAYS STAY CLOSE TO ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000947 I'M AN ALCHEMIST SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M AN ALCHEMIST HE SAID AS HE PREPARED THE MEAL
cv-valid-train-sample-000948 JENNIFER'S EXPRESSION CHANGED PULL MY FINGER SHE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000949 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000950 THE OLD MAN LEAFED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
cv-valid-train-sample-000951 I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000952 AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000953 THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
cv-valid-train-sample-000954 RELAXED AND UNHURRIED HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD WALK THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF TANGIER
cv-valid-train-sample-000955 THE MEETING WAS OVER
cv-valid-train-sample-000956 ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000957 THAT WASN'T AT ALL NECESSARY
cv-valid-train-sample-000958 I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
cv-valid-train-sample-000959 WHEN HE EMERGED IT WAS WITH A YOUNG ARAB DRESSED IN WHITE AND GOLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000960 WERE THEY QUICK OR WERE THEY ENRAGED
cv-valid-train-sample-000961 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000962 AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
cv-valid-train-sample-000963 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE IN HIS HEART THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO DO SO
cv-valid-train-sample-000964 THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000965 BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TWICE WILL SURELY HAPPEN A THIRD TIME
cv-valid-train-sample-000966 AND THIS IS WHAT YOUR SON SAID THE ANGEL TOLD THE MAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000967 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
cv-valid-train-sample-000968 WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS
cv-valid-train-sample-000969 IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER
cv-valid-train-sample-000970 HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000971 YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
cv-valid-train-sample-000972 IF IT WOULD SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE
cv-valid-train-sample-000973 HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
cv-valid-train-sample-000974 THEY WERE ALL FURIOUS WHEN THE ESCAPADE FAILED
cv-valid-train-sample-000975 IT ALWAYS HELPS TO BE LEARNING SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING
cv-valid-train-sample-000976 WHERE ARE YOU BOUND ASKED THE YOUNG ARAB
cv-valid-train-sample-000977 AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000978 I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000979 I'M NOT AFRAID OF FAILING
cv-valid-train-sample-000980 SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON
cv-valid-train-sample-000981 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train-sample-000982 ANY DOPE YET ON HOW HE GOT OUT
cv-valid-train-sample-000983 THEY'RE NOT FOR SALE HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000984 THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
cv-valid-train-sample-000985 MIND IF I SIT DOWN
cv-valid-train-sample-000986 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000987 HE HAD STUDIED LATIN SPANISH AND THEOLOGY
cv-valid-train-sample-000988 MR BEAN IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF A BRITISH COMEDY
cv-valid-train-sample-000989 THE IDEAS SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN A MORE CONCISE AND DIRECT MANNER
cv-valid-train-sample-000990 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
cv-valid-train-sample-000991 I'M GOING TO CHECK UP ON THAT RIGHT AWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000992 BUTMAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
cv-valid-train-sample-000993 I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000994 EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM
cv-valid-train-sample-000995 IT WAS ENGINEERING AT ITS FINEST
cv-valid-train-sample-000996 ALL THINGS ARE ONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000997 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000998 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000999 HOW ABOUT ONCE MORE AROUND THE PARK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000000 LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000001 EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE EVOLVED HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000002 YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000003 SO NOW I FEAR NOTHING BECAUSE IT WAS THOSE OMENS THAT BROUGHT YOU TO ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000004 IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000005 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000006 NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000007 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000008 PUT JACKIE RIGHT ON THE STAFF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000009 WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000010 YOU MUST NOT LET UP EVEN AFTER HAVING COME SO FAR HE CONTINUED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000011 IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE WAR IS OVER THEN WAIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000012 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000013 BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE AND DIDN'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000014 AS THEY BEGAN TO DECORATE THE HALLWAY A SILHOUETTE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000015 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000016 HE WAS MY BROTHER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000017 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000018 WE'LL PAY ALL YOUR EXPENSES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000019 THEN THEY GOT AHOLD OF SOME DOUGH AND WENT GOOFY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000020 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000021 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000022 FILL THIS PLACE WITH A SANDSTORM SO STRONG THAT IT BLOTS OUT THE SUN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000023 I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000024 I MAKE MY LIVING FORECASTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000025 I DO WANT THAT PLATINUM RING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000026 TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT I HAD A RECURRENT DREAM TOO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000027 DON'T LET THEM SEE THAT YOU'RE AFRAID THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000028 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000029 THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFF AGAIN BUT WHEN I LOOKED OUTSIDE THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000030 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000031 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000032 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000033 THE YEARS OF RESEARCH THE MAGIC SYMBOLS THE STRANGE WORDS AND THE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000034 I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000035 THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000036 ASK THE OWNER OF THAT STALL HOW MUCH THE SWORD COSTS HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000037 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000038 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY GIVE UP ON IT SO EARLY TOO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000039 A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000040 THE SNOW BLASTED ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000041 HAVE A GOOD TRIP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000042 TRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU'RE IN THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000043 SEPARATION OF GARBAGE MAKES RECYCLING POSSIBLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000044 THEY WERE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT AND CLAMORED TO HEAR HIS STORIES ABOUT THE GREAT CITIES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000045 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000046 THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COMPANY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000047 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000048 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000049 SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000050 JUST THE ANT COLONY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000051 SO THE BOY WAS DISAPPOINTED HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN BELIEVE IN DREAMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000052 HOW DO YOU MEAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000053 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT GIRL'S VERY SICK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000054 THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000055 THE TRADITION TEACHES MEN HOW TO CROSS THE DESERT AND HOW THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD MARRY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000056 I'M EVERYTHING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID I WAS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000057 I'M IN A DRUGSTORE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000058 IT REQUIRED NO EXPLANATION JUST AS THE UNIVERSE NEEDS NONE AS IT TRAVELS THROUGH ENDLESS TIME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000059 FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000060 EVEN IF YOU CLEANED MY CRYSTAL FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000061 MR BRAD CABLES YOU NEED CASH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000062 WAIT FOR THE END OF THE WAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000063 HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000064 IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE THE LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000065 YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WITCH DOCTORS HE SPOKE SOME VERSES FROM THE KORAN AND MOVED ON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000066 THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000067 IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000068 THE FLOCK OF FLAMINGOS LANDED GRACEFULLY ON THEIR AWKWARD LOOKING LEGS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000069 THE BOY WAS SAD AS HE LEFT HER THAT DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000070 SHE WENT OVER TO THE HOSPITAL TO CALL ON PROFESSOR DAVIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000071 THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT HIS DESTINY TO THE END
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000072 THE CHARCOAL BURNED AWAY TO WHITE ASH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000073 THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000074 WHAT IF YOU CAN'T STAND HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000075 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000076 HE DIDN'T NEED TO DEMONSTRATE HIS SCIENCE AND ART TO ANYONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000077 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000078 BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOVE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000079 BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000080 WHY DO YOU WANT TO FIND THAT SORT OF PERSON THE ARAB ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000081 THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000082 HOW DO YOU HANDLE THE NEGATIVE WEIGHTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000083 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000084 AND ALSO BY UNHAPPINESS ENVY AND JEALOUSY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000085 TO CALIBRATE THE MOTION CAPTURING SYSTEM PLEASE DO A TPOSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000086 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000087 THE ALCHEMIST FOLLOWED AS THE BOY'S HORSE RAN FOR ALMOST HALF AN HOUR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000088 ALL THIS HAPPENED BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNSET THE BOY THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000089 SHALL I PUT A LITTLE RUM IN THE COFFEE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000090 TO NOURISH THE FALCON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000091 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000092 WHO IS THIS STRANGER WHO SPEAKS OF OMENS ASKED ONE OF THE CHIEFTAINS EYEING THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000093 HELP MY FRIEND MR RICHARD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000094 WANT TO WALK TO NEW YORK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000095 DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000096 I DIDN'T FALL IN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000097 IT'S LATE IN THE EVENING A PERFECT TIME FOR COFFEE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000098 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000099 THE BOSS SENT ME OVER WITH IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000100 HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000101 THE FUMES FROM THE TRAFFIC WAS UNBEARABLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000102 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000103 THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000104 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000105 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY APPARENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000106 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000107 THE ENGLISHMAN HAD SEVERAL SUITCASES FILLED WITH BOOKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000108 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000109 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000110 WISH I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000111 HE STILL CALLS HIS MOTHER MUMMY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000112 IT'S COMMON TO RUN INTO PROBLEMS SO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000113 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000114 THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000115 HARRY'LL TEAR HIS DINNER SUIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000116 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000117 YOU'VE GOT HIS GUN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000118 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000119 IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT IT MATTERS A LOT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000120 WE MUST BE GOOD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000121 WATCH OVER HER TONIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000122 DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000123 THERE'S A MOON OUT TONIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000124 THE BOY REPEATED HIS QUESTION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000125 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000126 YOU'RE A WEEK LATE FOR SCHOOL ALREADY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000127 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000128 YOU HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR DREAMS ABOUT THE OLD KING AND YOUR TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000129 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000130 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000131 THE LEVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000132 WITH THE GIRL WITH THE RAVEN HAIR HIS DAYS WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000133 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000134 WEAR THE BLUE ONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000135 LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOURLEAF CLOVERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000136 I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000137 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000138 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000139 THE TWO WALKED OUT AMONG THE PALMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000140 HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000141 THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000142 MEN HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS OF THE WISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000143 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000144 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000145 GET THE BULLETIN BOARD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000146 THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000147 YOU TOLD ME THAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000148 NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000149 DO YOU WANT TO WAKE THAT BABY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000150 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000151 I NEVER STOLE A WATCH IN MY LIFE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000152 GOOD LUCK TO YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000153 MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000154 I WAS JUST ASKING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000155 LET HIM HAVE EVERYTHING HE WANTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000156 THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000157 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000158 EGYPT IS A COUNTRY THAT IS OFTEN MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000159 HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000160 THE BOY KNEW AND WAS NOW WORKING TOWARD IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000161 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000162 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000163 THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000164 IT IS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000165 THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000166 WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000167 THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000168 THE ALARM CLOCK WAS SET FOR TWENTY PAST THREE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000169 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000170 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000171 THE BOY WENT TO THE WELL EVERY DAY TO MEET WITH FATIMA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000172 IT'S THE NAME OF THE PROPHET'S DAUGHTER FATIMA SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000173 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000174 THE BOY REMEMBERED HIS DREAM AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR TO HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000175 GET SOME WATER QUICKLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000176 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000177 THERE WAS A LOUD SHRIEK FROM A WOMAN STANDING BEHIND US
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000178 THEN LEAVE WITH THE CARAVAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000179 HE IS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND JUST TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000180 YOU'RE STILL A GOOD REPORTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000181 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000182 THERE ISN'T ANY MORE WINE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000183 DOES THIS BELONG TO YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000184 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000185 THEY WANTED TO SAVE THE OASIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000186 TWO HORSEMEN WAITING AHEAD OF THEM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000187 I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000188 I DON'T MUCH LIKE CHANGE HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000189 THE DUNES ARE CHANGED BY THE WIND BUT THE DESERT NEVER CHANGES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000190 SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000191 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000192 HE'S IN MY ROOM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000193 IS SHE AS GOOD AS YOU SAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000194 THEY FILLED THREE SACKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000195 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000196 THIS IS THE MORNING POST YOU'RE TALKING TO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000197 YOU WILL SPEND THAT HOUR GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH MARSHALL BAILEY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000198 THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000199 IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000200 THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000201 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000202 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000203 I KNOW ITS DIMENSIONS AND HOW IT BEHAVES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000204 OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000205 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000206 TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000207 GET DOWN QUICK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000208 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000209 HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HOLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000210 YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000211 IT WAS HARASSMENT PURE AND SIMPLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000212 THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS CAPE AND THE BOY WAS STRUCK BY WHAT HE SAW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000213 HOW WAS THAT FOR A TIGHT SQUEEZE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000214 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000215 WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000216 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000217 GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SEASON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000218 THE DISPLAY WAS UNDERWHELMING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000219 NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FELLOWS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000220 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000221 THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000222 I'M GONNA BUILD AIR FIELDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000223 HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000224 A POX UPON ME FOR A CLUMSY THING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000225 STOVE'S HOTTER THAN I THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000226 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000227 THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000228 IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000229 YOU THINK IT'S EASY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000230 THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000231 I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000232 THE WIRELESS JOYPAD WAS EXPERIENCING CONNECTION ISSUES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000233 AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000234 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000235 IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000236 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000237 THAT'S WHY ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE NICE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000238 THIS IS A TRICK TO GET YOUR SYMPATHY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000239 IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000240 THE SHOP WAS BUSY AND THE MAN ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000241 SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000242 TONIGHT THEY WOULD FIND OUT THE TRUTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000243 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000244 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000245 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000246 HE HAD ASSUMED HE WOULD SOON RETURN TO HIS SHEEP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000247 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000248 NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000249 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000250 HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000251 I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000252 THIS IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION SHELDON SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000253 I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000254 IT ALL HAPPENED RATHER SUDDENLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000255 SURE SEE YOU THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000256 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000257 A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000258 HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000259 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000260 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000261 PATRICK HAS TERMINAL CANCER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000262 THIS IS JON DAVIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000263 THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000264 ONE AFTERNOON ONE OF HIS SERVANTS FELL ILL AND IT APPEARED THAT HE WOULD DIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000265 ACCORDING TO THE PREDOMINANT NOTION IN THE VATICAN CONDOMS SHOULDN'T BE USED IN SPITE OF HIV
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000266 BUT YOU ARE FORCING ME TO LOOK AT WEALTH AND AT HORIZONS I HAVE NEVER KNOWN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000267 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000268 HE PAID FOR THE WOOL AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000269 THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000270 AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000271 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000272 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000273 I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000274 I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000275 MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000276 ARABS OFTEN APPEARED IN THE CITY SHOPPING AND CHANTING THEIR STRANGE PRAYERS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000277 THERE IS A REPTILE IN MY WESTERN SHOES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000278 HOW ARE YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000279 I WANT TO STAY AT THE OASIS THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000280 AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000281 WHAT'S IN THAT DESK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000282 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000283 I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000284 THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000285 SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000286 DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AT AN ABANDONED CHURCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000287 EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000288 BECAUSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WOULD FIND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000289 IN HIS HEART HE WANTED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO SLEEP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000290 THE BOY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000291 THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000292 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000293 WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000294 THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000295 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000296 THE BOY SWORE THAT EVERY TIME HE HEARD THE ALARM HE WOULD HEED ITS MESSAGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000297 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000298 I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000299 WE CAN ONLY PERCEIVE A PART OF THE BROAD LIGHT SPECTRUM THE SUN EMITS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000300 THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000301 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000302 FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000303 I DON'T KNOW YOU FROM ADAM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000304 THEY WERE RACING DOWN THE STREETS WITH NO REGARD FOR ANYONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000305 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000306 IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000307 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000308 THERESA COULDN'T FEEL ANY MORE DUMB RIGHT NOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000309 HE'S ALLERGIC TO HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000310 I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET SOME STYLISH UNDERWEAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000311 THIRTY EVERY THURSDAY SIXTY AT SIXTY WHO KNOWS WHAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000312 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000313 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000314 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000315 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000316 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000317 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000318 THERE'S A LOT MORE YOU CAN DO WITH A TIGHTER INTEGRATION WITH THE EYE TRACKING API
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000319 HE KNEW WHAT I WAS THINKING THE BOY SAID TO HIMSELF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000320 WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO WRITE ABOUT HILLARY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000321 HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000322 JOHNATHAN ASSESSED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000323 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000324 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000325 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000326 HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THE STRANGE LAND HE WAS IN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000327 FROM THAT DAY ON IT WAS THE DESERT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000328 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000329 AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE MAN LIVED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000330 IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000331 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000332 IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELED BY FIREWOOD WITH A TRANSPARENT FLASK HEATING ON TOP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000333 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000334 SO IMMERSE YOURSELF IN IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000335 WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000336 BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000337 HIS NAME IS WELCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000338 THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000339 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000340 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000341 THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000342 THE MAN LOOKED AT THE ANGEL IN SURPRISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000343 BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000344 THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MORE TEA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000345 THAT WAS HIS WORK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000346 WHAT YOUR HUSBAND WAS MIXED UP IN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000347 THE BOY RECALLED THE BRILLIANCE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000348 IF I'M ON THE MARCH I JUST CONCENTRATE ON MARCHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000349 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000350 THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000351 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000352 IT'S THE ONLY ONE THEY HAD LEFT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000353 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000354 HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000355 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000356 THERE WAS NO OTHER BAGGAGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000357 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000358 DID YOU SAY A KING HE ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000359 WHAT HE SAID REMINDED THE BOY OF THE OLD KING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000360 BUT WE COULD SELL TEA IN CRYSTAL GLASSES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000361 HE WAS THINKING ABOUT OMENS AND SOMEONE HAD APPEARED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000362 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000363 IN THE DISCOTHEQUE THE DJ PLAYED PROGRESSIVE HOUSE MUSIC AND TRANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000364 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000365 I'VE WATCHED YOU GROW UP FROM A LITTLE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000366 IT'S THE ONLY NAME I'VE GOT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000367 THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000368 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000369 I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000370 IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000371 THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000372 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000373 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000374 BUT AS TIME PASSED TANGIER HAD CHANGED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000375 MY KEYCHAIN IS HEAVY AND AWKWARD TO CARRY IN MY POCKET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000376 I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000377 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000378 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000379 I KNOW THAT GIRL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000380 HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000381 BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000382 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000383 LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000384 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000385 HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000386 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000387 HOW COULD HE BE A FAKE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000388 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000389 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000390 ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000391 I FEEL LIKE A BOOTLEGGER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000392 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000393 THEN GET OUT OF HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000394 THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000395 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000396 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000397 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000398 YOU ALL KNOW ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000399 WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PLODDING THROUGH SOME USER INTERVIEWS AT THE MOMENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000400 I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THAT TUB
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000401 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000402 THIS DESERT WAS ONCE A SEA HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000403 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000404 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000405 HE HAD NO IDEA HOW HE WAS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000406 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000407 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000408 THAT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000409 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000410 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000411 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000412 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000413 SHE JOINED UP TOO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000414 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000415 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000416 THERE'S LIFE HERE THE BOY SAID TO THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000417 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000418 I'M GOING TO THEM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000419 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000420 IT BELONGS TO ME NOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000421 HAS HE BEEN HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000422 BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000423 YOU SAID YOU WANTED FIREWORKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000424 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000425 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000426 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000427 I WISH THEY WERE TOO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000428 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000429 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000430 THEY WERE ALWAYS JUST SOMEBODY TO FILL UP THE BLEACHERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000431 DONT FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE IT WOULD NOT HELP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000432 THERE WAS A SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE STATUE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000433 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000434 HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000435 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000436 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000437 NOBODY'S TRYING TO STEAL FROM YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000438 BUT HE FOUND IT MUCH MORE INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THE CARAVAN AND LISTEN TO THE WIND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000439 IT CONSIDERS THE HORIZONTAL DIMENSION AS TIME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000440 HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000441 ALWAYS HEED THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000442 IT COMMENCED TO BLOW HARDER RAISING THE DESERT SANDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000443 WELL WHAT GOOD WOULD IT BE TO YOU IF YOU HAD T DIE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000444 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000445 CAROL SAVED HER BROTHER'S LIFE THAT DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000446 IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000447 THAT HE HAD ATTENDED A SEMINARY UNTIL HE WAS SIXTEEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000448 I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000449 KEEP HIM IN HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000450 MAYBE TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER THAN YESTERDAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000451 SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALEX PRETTY WELL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000452 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000453 WHEN THE SIMUM CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000454 THE FOREST BURNED FOR THIRTEEN DAYS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000455 WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000456 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000457 HE WASHED THE DETRITUS FROM HIS HAIR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000458 THAT'S WHAT ALCHEMISTS DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000459 HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000460 THE RESTAURANT WAS QUITE EXPENSIVE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000461 PHONE THE NEWSPAPERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000462 HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000463 HE AROSE AND TAKING UP HIS CROOK BEGAN TO AWAKEN THE SHEEP THAT STILL SLEPT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000464 THE SHEPHERD SWORE THAT HE WOULD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000465 AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000466 MAKTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000467 I DIDN'T FRISK HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000468 HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000469 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000470 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000471 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000472 I'M LEAVING TODAY SAID THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000473 THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000474 I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000475 AND TOMORROW HIS ENEMY WOULD ALSO BE A PART OF THAT SOUL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000476 I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000477 SO THEN TRY HE SAID TO THE ENGLISHMAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000478 I DON'T BELIEVE IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000479 THE VIRUS SPREAD FASTER THAN WILDFIRE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000480 THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000481 I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000482 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000483 PERHAPS SHE MET SOMEBODY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000484 TAKE YOUR PAWS OFF ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000485 APPLE PIE IS AN ICONIC DISH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000486 AM I GOING TO FIND MY TREASURE HE ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000487 THE ACHIEVED RESULTS ARE FAR BEHIND THE STATEOFTHEART IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000488 THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000489 COACH HAS HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000490 THE SUN WAS TURNED INTO A GOLDEN DISK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000491 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000492 THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000493 AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000494 IF HE ABANDONS THAT PURSUIT IT'S BECAUSE IT WASN'T TRUELOVE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000495 THE OASIS IS NEUTRAL GROUND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000496 WHAT DO YOU SAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000497 I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000498 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000499 SURE I KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000500 HE'S THE MAN THE ADS ARE WRITTEN FOR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000501 AND ABOVE ALL DON'T FORGET TO FOLLOW YOUR DESTINY THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000502 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000503 I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000504 WE WANT SOME ACTION IN THESE PICTURES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000505 SYMBOLS OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000506 THIS GUY STOLE MY WATCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000507 IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WINE HE HAD EVER TASTED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000508 IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000509 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000510 THE SPACE WAS SPARTAN ALMOST BARE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000511 DO YOU MIND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE CROWDED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000512 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000513 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000514 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000515 HE'S THE ONLY HUSBAND I'VE GOT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000516 THIS IS FOR YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000517 THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000518 HE NEVER ASKED ME TO SIT DOWN IN HIS LIFE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000519 MY NAME'S PETE DAVIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000520 PRETTY NICE NECK YOU'VE GOT THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000521 AN ARMY IS COMING THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000522 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000523 YOU MEAN HERE IN THE CITY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000524 REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOUR HEART IS THERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000525 REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOUR HEART IS THERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000526 I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000527 THE BOY APPROACHED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000528 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000529 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000530 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000531 HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000532 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000533 THE BOY FELT ILL AND TERRIBLY ALONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000534 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000535 WILL YOU EXCUSE US A MINUTE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000536 I'M LOVING IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000537 AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000538 YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000539 YOUR HEART IS ALIVE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000540 PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS VILLAGE SON SAID HIS FATHER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000541 AND THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY WELL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000542 VICTORIA DOES THINGS IN A MUCH BIGGER WAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000543 I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000544 I'D HATE TO HAVE THAT MANY PINS STUCK IN ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000545 BUT WHAT'S ALL THIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000546 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000547 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000548 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000549 HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000550 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000551 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000552 WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000553 HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000554 DOESNT IT DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF HASHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000555 AND THAT HE A BOY COULD PERFORM MIRACLES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000556 IT WON'T HURT YOU AND WE CAN MAKE THE CITY EDITION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000557 THE NAVY'S GOING TO FLY FATHER HOME THIS AFTERNOON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000558 HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000559 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000560 WE ATE SPICY RICE WITH CHICKEN LEGS AND WHITE MUSHROOMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000561 THE HEAT LASTED UNTIL NIGHTFALL AND ALL THAT TIME HE HAD TO CARRY HIS JACKET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000562 AND I'LL SIGN A PAPER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000563 THAT'S AN INHERENT DISADVANTAGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000564 I'D BETTER HUSTLE HIM UP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000565 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000566 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000567 I'M AFRAID SHE'D FEEL ASHAMED TO THINK SHE HADN'T TRUSTED YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000568 BUT I'M GOING TO EGYPT THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000569 WHAT WERE YOU WHEN YOU CAME HERE FIVE YEARS AGO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000570 I GOT IT BACK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000571 I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000572 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000573 FASTFOOD IS CONVENIENT BUT OFTEN UNHEALTHY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000574 HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE MORNING'S MEETING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000575 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000576 THE NEARBY CITY OF CEUTA HAD GROWN FASTER THAN TANGIER AND BUSINESS HAD FALLEN OFF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000577 HE'S DEPOSITED TEN DOLLARS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000578 ONLY US EXPLORERS CAN GET IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000579 JUST A MEMORY RIGHT NOW IT SIGNIFIED SHADE WATER AND A REFUGE FROM THE WAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000580 THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000581 DIDN'T I TELL YOU NEVER TO COME PANHANDLING AROUND HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000582 THIS WILL HELP YOU EFFECTIVELY COLLABORATE WITH DEVELOPERS AND COORDINATE CROSSTEAM PROJECTS THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000583 BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000584 BUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT HAD NO CHOICE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000585 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000586 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000587 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000588 THE MAN WEPT WITH HAPPINESS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000589 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000590 COME IN AGAIN SOME TIME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000591 RAISINS ARE DELICIOUS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000592 HE WANTED YOUR MONEY HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000593 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000594 MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000595 YOU MUSTN'T LET WHAT SHE SAID BOTHER YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000596 SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME THE SUN ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000597 HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU GET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000598 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000599 HOW DO I GUESS AT THE FUTURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000600 LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000601 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000602 DON'T MIND THE COLONEL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000603 HE THOUGHT OF ALL THE MARRIED SHEPHERDS HE HAD KNOWN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000604 I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000605 AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000606 WHAT IS A FOREIGNER DOING HERE ASKED ANOTHER OF THE MEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000607 AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000608 THERE'S THAT REPRIEVE IF THEY EVER FIND OUT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000609 THREE DAYS FROM NOW HE WOULD BE WITH THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000610 IF YOU DON'T STOP FOLLOWING ME I'LL CALL THE POLICE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000611 BUT MAYBE PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT WAY HAD NEVER LEARNED THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000612 BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000613 LOOKS LIKE ABOUT TEN YEARS A PIECE FOR YOU BIRDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000614 HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000615 THE OTHER SON WAS A POET AND DELIGHTED ALL OF ROME WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL VERSES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000616 HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000617 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000618 ONE MUST PREPARE FOR IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000619 BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUMNI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000620 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000621 IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000622 A MAN DOESN'T GET IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS EVERY DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000623 CAN I GET A WOOT WOOT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000624 I THINK IT'S ABOUT BIRD HUNTING BUT NOW I CAN SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000625 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000626 SUNBURNS CAN BE AVOIDED BY APPLYING SUNSCREEN OR BY STAYING IN THE SHADOWS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000627 IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000628 IF HE EVER DECIDED TO LEAVE THEM THEY WOULD SUFFER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000629 TAKE CHARGE OF HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000630 I LOST MY WALLET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000631 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000632 HE'S NUTS ABOUT YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000633 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000634 I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRANSMITTED BY WORD OF MOUTH HE THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000635 IT'S THE OTHER FOREIGNER THE ENGLISHMAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000636 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000637 THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOSED OFF THE CONVERSATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000638 YOU'LL NEVER GET IT OUT OF ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000639 IT WAS THE PURE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000640 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000641 I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000642 I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CHANGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000643 IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000644 THEY WENT TO THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE MONASTERY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000645 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000646 IF WHAT ONE FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTER IT WILL NEVER SPOIL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000647 WILL I LEARN TO DO THAT SOMEDAY THE BOY ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000648 THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000649 HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000650 BY THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION I SAW THEM STAGGERING AND FALLING AND THEIR SUPPORTERS TURNING TO RUN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000651 AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000652 IT HAD TOLD HIM TO DIG WHERE HIS TEARS FELL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000653 HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000654 MOHAMMED IS A WONDERFUL GUITAR PLAYER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000655 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000656 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000657 A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000658 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000659 LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000660 THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000661 AND HE KNEW WHAT WAS THE FAIR PRICE FOR EVERY ONE OF HIS ANIMALS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000662 MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000663 MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000664 THEY'RE CALLING TO US NOT TO GIVE UP AND TO KEEP ON FIGHTING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000665 IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000666 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000667 OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000668 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000669 I'M GOING TO THEM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000670 I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000671 SUNBURNS CAN BE AVOIDED BY APPLYING SUNSCREEN OR BY STAYING IN THE SHADOWS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000672 THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000673 AND THE LAST ONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000674 A LOT OF MONEY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000675 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000676 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000677 I SAID I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000678 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000679 I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000680 ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE EVERY LIE HE TELLS YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000681 THERE WAS A HOLE THERE AMONG THE STONES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000682 LICORICE IS A BLACK CHEWY FOOD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000683 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000684 THE SHEEP FIDGETED NEARBY UNEASY WITH THEIR NEW OWNER AND EXCITED BY SO MUCH CHANGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000685 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000686 HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000687 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000688 THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000689 I DIDN'T COME HERE TO HAVE YOU READ MY PALM HE SAID ALREADY REGRETTING HAVING COME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000690 I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT MY HORIZON HAS EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000691 IT SORT OF MAKES A FELLOW LOSE FAITH IN HIMSELF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000692 THOSE GYPSIES ARE REALLY SMART HE THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000693 DO I LOOK AS FUNNY AS YOU DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000694 BUT I'M LIABLE TO GET INTO A JAM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000695 ALL THE VILLAGERS CHEERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000696 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000697 THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000698 THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000699 YOU BROUGHT A NEW FEELING INTO MY CRYSTAL SHOP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000700 THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000701 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000702 BECAUSE HE WAS TERRIFIED THE BOY DIDN'T ANSWER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000703 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000704 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000705 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000706 IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000707 WHAT GOOD IS MONEY TO YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000708 THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000709 SORT OF A JACK LONDON STYLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000710 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000711 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000712 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000713 BUT HE GRANTED THE TRAVELERS THREE DAYS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000714 WELL THEN HELP ME DO THAT THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000715 I AM HERE THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000716 THE ARROW WAS POINTING TO THE EXIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000717 I'M GOING TO GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE DESERT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000718 DO YOU SEE THIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000719 THEY WERE TRIBESMEN DRESSED IN BLUE WITH BLACK RINGS SURROUNDING THEIR TURBANS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000720 THE LIBRARY IS OPEN TO EVERYONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000721 THAT'S COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000722 IT WAS A TENT LIKE MANY AT THE OASIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000723 HE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE PRACTICAL MATTERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000724 SHE WROTE THE STUFF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000725 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000726 THE HOOKAHS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUARDS STOOD AT ATTENTION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000727 ANOTHER WHO WAS SEARCHING THE BOY'S BAGS FOUND THE PIECE OF GOLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000728 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000729 I NEVER SAW AMANDA ACT LIKE THAT BEFORE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000730 THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO COOL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000731 OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000732 FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000733 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000734 BECAUSE NOW HE KNEW WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000735 DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET HIDING PLACE HERE IN THE HOUSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000736 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN ANYTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000737 I'M GOING TO NEED IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000738 I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000739 I BET YOU FORGOT THE WINE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000740 NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000741 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000742 THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000743 AS HE WAS LEAVING HE SAW IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM HIS OLD SHEPHERD'S POUCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000744 IS THERE A MRS JOSHUA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000745 I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000746 YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000747 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000748 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000749 THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000750 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000751 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000752 THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000753 WHAT TRICKS WOULD I PULL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000754 THIS SOLUTION ALSO WORKS WELL IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL A LINUX DISTRO ON WINDOWS VIA VIRTUALIZATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000755 BECAUSE FOR HIM YOU ARE A GREEN FIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000756 DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000757 IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000758 BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000759 FEBRUARY TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000760 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000761 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000762 THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000763 UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000764 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000765 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ROMANTIC
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000766 THE FOOTBALL JOCKS LAUGHED VICIOUSLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000767 YOU'RE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000768 THE ELEVATORS ARE STILL RUNNING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000769 BUT USE THEM TO BUY YOUR FLOCK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000770 THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000771 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000772 BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000773 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000774 THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000775 HAVE YOU GOT A MIRROR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000776 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000777 THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000778 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000779 THE PILOTS BRACED THEMSELVES FOR IMPACT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000780 IT WAS A A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000781 LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000782 HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000783 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000784 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000785 HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000786 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000787 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000788 I CAN EXPLAIN IF YOU'LL JUST LISTEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000789 THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000790 IT'S NOT A LIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000791 IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000792 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000793 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000794 NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000795 HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000796 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000797 JUST AS A RULE OF THUMB
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000798 I REALLY DID IT QUITE BRILLIANTLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000799 AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000800 GET ME WALTER BURNS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000801 HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000802 PEOPLE CONTINUED TO COME AND GO FROM THE BAKER'S SHOP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000803 THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000804 YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000805 WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000806 FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000807 I WISH YOU'D FORGET ABOUT US
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000808 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000809 THE BOOK THAT MOST INTERESTED THE BOY TOLD THE STORIES OF THE FAMOUS ALCHEMISTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000810 ARE YOU CRAZY THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000811 THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000812 MY ALLERGY HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE TODAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000813 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING AND LOAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000814 BEEN SEEING ME IN YOUR DREAMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000815 THE STRANGER WITHDREW THE SWORD FROM THE BOY'S FOREHEAD AND THE BOY FELT IMMENSELY RELIEVED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000816 SHE NEVER GREW UP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000817 THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000818 FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000819 MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000820 SAME WAY YOU DID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000821 THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000822 WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000823 AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000824 I WANT THOSE STAMPS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000825 I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000826 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000827 THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000828 MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000829 BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000830 YOU WILL NEVER REOPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000831 YOU DONT COMPARE DIRECTLY TO EXISTING STATEOFTHEART METHODS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000832 BUT HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DESIRE THAT AN ARMY INVADE THE OASIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000833 I'M SMOKING TOO MUCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000834 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000835 AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000836 THE TEA SEEMED LESS BITTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000837 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000838 NOT TO WORRY SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000839 EARLIER THIS YEAR WE FOUND A REALLY NICE PLACE NEAR MY OFFICE AND WE MOVED IN TOGETHER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000840 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000841 THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000842 WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000843 TWO DAYS AGO YOU SAID THAT I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TRAVEL THE MERCHANT ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000844 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000845 HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS WERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000846 MECCA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000847 THAT NIGHT HE TOLD ALL OF THIS TO THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000848 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000849 FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000850 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000851 THE ALCHEMIST ERASED THE CIRCLE IN THE SAND AND THE SNAKE SLITHERED AWAY AMONG THE ROCKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000852 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000853 I'M AFRAID THE JOKE'S ON US
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000854 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000855 THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000856 THE BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS A SURPRISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000857 THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000858 YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000859 AND WHAT A WAY TO QUIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000860 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000861 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000862 AND STOP THREATENING THAT BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000863 THEN HE TURNED TO THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000864 FOR USERS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY CAN TRUST THEIR OPERATING SYSTEM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000865 WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO TO MECCA NOW ASKED THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000866 THE MONK WAS IRRITATED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000867 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000868 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000869 CAN'T YOU READ ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000870 ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE BOY THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000871 DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000872 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000873 THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000874 HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000875 WILL YOU GIVE ME THOSE STAMPS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000876 I LEFT HER HANGING AROUND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000877 HE HAD BEEN TO THE VILLAGE ONLY ONCE THE YEAR BEFORE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000878 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000879 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000880 WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000881 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000882 LOOK AT THOSE SHOULDERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000883 THE SUN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000884 SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000885 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000886 I WILL BE BACK SOON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000887 WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000888 MRS SARAH DOESN'T EITHER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000889 WELLI DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000890 HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000891 I THOUGHT YOU WERE CHASING ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000892 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000893 NOTE THAT IT DOES HAVE BUILTIN SUPPORT FOR WEB BROWSING ALTHOUGH I FIND IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000894 THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000895 THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT SORTS OF FUEL AT THIS GAS STATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000896 I GOTTA FIGURE SOME WAY OUT OF THIS THING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000897 IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000898 THIS BEHAVIOR OF NEURAL NETWORKS IS SOMETIMES CALLED DREAMING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000899 DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000900 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000901 THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000902 THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000903 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000904 ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000905 I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE HIM SINCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000906 I'M AFRAID I MIGHT HAVE SOILED THE COUCH A LITTLE WITH MY SHOES EDDIE MURPHY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000907 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000908 THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SO DID THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000909 WHO TOLD YOU THAT ASKED THE BOY STARTLED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000910 HE DECIDED TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000911 MY FATHER OFFERED HER A JOB
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000912 IT WAS PAPA THAT SENDS YOU FLOWERS EVERY DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000913 ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000914 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000915 I JUMPED IN TO SAVE RACHEL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000916 THAT'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000917 IS THE HEAD BETTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000918 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000919 THAT WOMAN IS GONNA BE ON THAT ROOF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000920 I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000921 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000922 HE RECITED AN OUR FATHER SILENTLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000923 THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000924 AND HERE'S A KISS FOR YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000925 WHO WROTE THAT SPEECH FOR YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000926 SAVE THAT FOR THE TRIBUNE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000927 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000928 SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000929 I DON'T LIKE SEALS ANYHOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000930 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000931 AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000932 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO LEARN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000933 YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000934 THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000935 THE SHIP APPEARED TO BE CONSTRUCTED WITH SOME FORM OF CHROMIUM EXOSKELETON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000936 NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECKPOINTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000937 IT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT GUARANTEES EVERYONE'S FREEDOM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000938 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000939 A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000940 MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000941 YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAY DIE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000942 THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000943 THEN A MAN APPROACHED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000944 BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000945 AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000946 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY ALWAYS STAY CLOSE TO ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000947 I'M AN ALCHEMIST SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M AN ALCHEMIST HE SAID AS HE PREPARED THE MEAL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000948 JENNIFER'S EXPRESSION CHANGED PULL MY FINGER SHE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000949 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000950 THE OLD MAN LEAFED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000951 I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000952 AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000953 THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000954 RELAXED AND UNHURRIED HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD WALK THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF TANGIER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000955 THE MEETING WAS OVER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000956 ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000957 THAT WASN'T AT ALL NECESSARY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000958 I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000959 WHEN HE EMERGED IT WAS WITH A YOUNG ARAB DRESSED IN WHITE AND GOLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000960 WERE THEY QUICK OR WERE THEY ENRAGED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000961 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000962 AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000963 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE IN HIS HEART THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO DO SO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000964 THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000965 BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TWICE WILL SURELY HAPPEN A THIRD TIME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000966 AND THIS IS WHAT YOUR SON SAID THE ANGEL TOLD THE MAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000967 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000968 WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000969 IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000970 HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000971 YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000972 IF IT WOULD SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000973 HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000974 THEY WERE ALL FURIOUS WHEN THE ESCAPADE FAILED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000975 IT ALWAYS HELPS TO BE LEARNING SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000976 WHERE ARE YOU BOUND ASKED THE YOUNG ARAB
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000977 AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000978 I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000979 I'M NOT AFRAID OF FAILING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000980 SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000981 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000982 ANY DOPE YET ON HOW HE GOT OUT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000983 THEY'RE NOT FOR SALE HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000984 THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000985 MIND IF I SIT DOWN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000986 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000987 HE HAD STUDIED LATIN SPANISH AND THEOLOGY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000988 MR BEAN IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF A BRITISH COMEDY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000989 THE IDEAS SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN A MORE CONCISE AND DIRECT MANNER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000990 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000991 I'M GOING TO CHECK UP ON THAT RIGHT AWAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000992 BUTMAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000993 I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000994 EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000995 IT WAS ENGINEERING AT ITS FINEST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000996 ALL THINGS ARE ONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000997 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000998 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000999 HOW ABOUT ONCE MORE AROUND THE PARK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000000 LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000001 EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE EVOLVED HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000002 YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000003 SO NOW I FEAR NOTHING BECAUSE IT WAS THOSE OMENS THAT BROUGHT YOU TO ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000004 IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000005 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000006 NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000007 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000008 PUT JACKIE RIGHT ON THE STAFF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000009 WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000010 YOU MUST NOT LET UP EVEN AFTER HAVING COME SO FAR HE CONTINUED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000011 IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE WAR IS OVER THEN WAIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000012 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000013 BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE AND DIDN'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000014 AS THEY BEGAN TO DECORATE THE HALLWAY A SILHOUETTE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000015 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000016 HE WAS MY BROTHER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000017 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000018 WE'LL PAY ALL YOUR EXPENSES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000019 THEN THEY GOT AHOLD OF SOME DOUGH AND WENT GOOFY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000020 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000021 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000022 FILL THIS PLACE WITH A SANDSTORM SO STRONG THAT IT BLOTS OUT THE SUN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000023 I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000024 I MAKE MY LIVING FORECASTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000025 I DO WANT THAT PLATINUM RING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000026 TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT I HAD A RECURRENT DREAM TOO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000027 DON'T LET THEM SEE THAT YOU'RE AFRAID THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000028 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000029 THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFF AGAIN BUT WHEN I LOOKED OUTSIDE THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000030 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000031 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000032 BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000033 THE YEARS OF RESEARCH THE MAGIC SYMBOLS THE STRANGE WORDS AND THE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000034 I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000035 THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000036 ASK THE OWNER OF THAT STALL HOW MUCH THE SWORD COSTS HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000037 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000038 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY GIVE UP ON IT SO EARLY TOO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000039 A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000040 THE SNOW BLASTED ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000041 HAVE A GOOD TRIP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000042 TRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU'RE IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000043 SEPARATION OF GARBAGE MAKES RECYCLING POSSIBLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000044 THEY WERE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT AND CLAMORED TO HEAR HIS STORIES ABOUT THE GREAT CITIES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000045 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000046 THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COMPANY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000047 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000048 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000049 SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000050 JUST THE ANT COLONY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000051 SO THE BOY WAS DISAPPOINTED HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN BELIEVE IN DREAMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000052 HOW DO YOU MEAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000053 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT GIRL'S VERY SICK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000054 THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000055 THE TRADITION TEACHES MEN HOW TO CROSS THE DESERT AND HOW THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD MARRY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000056 I'M EVERYTHING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID I WAS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000057 I'M IN A DRUGSTORE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000058 IT REQUIRED NO EXPLANATION JUST AS THE UNIVERSE NEEDS NONE AS IT TRAVELS THROUGH ENDLESS TIME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000059 FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000060 EVEN IF YOU CLEANED MY CRYSTAL FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000061 MR BRAD CABLES YOU NEED CASH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000062 WAIT FOR THE END OF THE WAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000063 HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000064 IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE THE LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000065 YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WITCH DOCTORS HE SPOKE SOME VERSES FROM THE KORAN AND MOVED ON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000066 THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000067 IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000068 THE FLOCK OF FLAMINGOS LANDED GRACEFULLY ON THEIR AWKWARD LOOKING LEGS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000069 THE BOY WAS SAD AS HE LEFT HER THAT DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000070 SHE WENT OVER TO THE HOSPITAL TO CALL ON PROFESSOR DAVIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000071 THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT HIS DESTINY TO THE END
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000072 THE CHARCOAL BURNED AWAY TO WHITE ASH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000073 THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000074 WHAT IF YOU CAN'T STAND HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000075 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000076 HE DIDN'T NEED TO DEMONSTRATE HIS SCIENCE AND ART TO ANYONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000077 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000078 BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOVE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000079 BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000080 WHY DO YOU WANT TO FIND THAT SORT OF PERSON THE ARAB ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000081 THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000082 HOW DO YOU HANDLE THE NEGATIVE WEIGHTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000083 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000084 AND ALSO BY UNHAPPINESS ENVY AND JEALOUSY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000085 TO CALIBRATE THE MOTION CAPTURING SYSTEM PLEASE DO A TPOSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000086 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000087 THE ALCHEMIST FOLLOWED AS THE BOY'S HORSE RAN FOR ALMOST HALF AN HOUR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000088 ALL THIS HAPPENED BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNSET THE BOY THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000089 SHALL I PUT A LITTLE RUM IN THE COFFEE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000090 TO NOURISH THE FALCON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000091 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000092 WHO IS THIS STRANGER WHO SPEAKS OF OMENS ASKED ONE OF THE CHIEFTAINS EYEING THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000093 HELP MY FRIEND MR RICHARD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000094 WANT TO WALK TO NEW YORK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000095 DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000096 I DIDN'T FALL IN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000097 IT'S LATE IN THE EVENING A PERFECT TIME FOR COFFEE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000098 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000099 THE BOSS SENT ME OVER WITH IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000100 HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000101 THE FUMES FROM THE TRAFFIC WAS UNBEARABLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000102 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000103 THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000104 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000105 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY APPARENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000106 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000107 THE ENGLISHMAN HAD SEVERAL SUITCASES FILLED WITH BOOKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000108 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000109 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000110 WISH I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000111 HE STILL CALLS HIS MOTHER MUMMY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000112 IT'S COMMON TO RUN INTO PROBLEMS SO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000113 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000114 THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000115 HARRY'LL TEAR HIS DINNER SUIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000116 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000117 YOU'VE GOT HIS GUN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000118 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000119 IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT IT MATTERS A LOT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000120 WE MUST BE GOOD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000121 WATCH OVER HER TONIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000122 DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000123 THERE'S A MOON OUT TONIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000124 THE BOY REPEATED HIS QUESTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000125 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000126 YOU'RE A WEEK LATE FOR SCHOOL ALREADY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000127 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000128 YOU HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR DREAMS ABOUT THE OLD KING AND YOUR TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000129 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000130 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000131 THE LEVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000132 WITH THE GIRL WITH THE RAVEN HAIR HIS DAYS WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000133 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000134 WEAR THE BLUE ONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000135 LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOURLEAF CLOVERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000136 I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000137 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000138 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000139 THE TWO WALKED OUT AMONG THE PALMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000140 HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000141 THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000142 MEN HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS OF THE WISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000143 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000144 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000145 GET THE BULLETIN BOARD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000146 THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000147 YOU TOLD ME THAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000148 NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000149 DO YOU WANT TO WAKE THAT BABY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000150 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000151 I NEVER STOLE A WATCH IN MY LIFE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000152 GOOD LUCK TO YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000153 MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000154 I WAS JUST ASKING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000155 LET HIM HAVE EVERYTHING HE WANTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000156 THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000157 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000158 EGYPT IS A COUNTRY THAT IS OFTEN MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000159 HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000160 THE BOY KNEW AND WAS NOW WORKING TOWARD IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000161 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000162 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000163 THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000164 IT IS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000165 THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000166 WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000167 THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000168 THE ALARM CLOCK WAS SET FOR TWENTY PAST THREE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000169 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000170 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000171 THE BOY WENT TO THE WELL EVERY DAY TO MEET WITH FATIMA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000172 IT'S THE NAME OF THE PROPHET'S DAUGHTER FATIMA SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000173 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000174 THE BOY REMEMBERED HIS DREAM AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR TO HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000175 GET SOME WATER QUICKLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000176 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000177 THERE WAS A LOUD SHRIEK FROM A WOMAN STANDING BEHIND US
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000178 THEN LEAVE WITH THE CARAVAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000179 HE IS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND JUST TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000180 YOU'RE STILL A GOOD REPORTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000181 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000182 THERE ISN'T ANY MORE WINE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000183 DOES THIS BELONG TO YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000184 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000185 THEY WANTED TO SAVE THE OASIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000186 TWO HORSEMEN WAITING AHEAD OF THEM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000187 I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000188 I DON'T MUCH LIKE CHANGE HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000189 THE DUNES ARE CHANGED BY THE WIND BUT THE DESERT NEVER CHANGES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000190 SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000191 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000192 HE'S IN MY ROOM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000193 IS SHE AS GOOD AS YOU SAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000194 THEY FILLED THREE SACKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000195 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000196 THIS IS THE MORNING POST YOU'RE TALKING TO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000197 YOU WILL SPEND THAT HOUR GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH MARSHALL BAILEY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000198 THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000199 IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000200 THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000201 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000202 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000203 I KNOW ITS DIMENSIONS AND HOW IT BEHAVES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000204 OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000205 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000206 TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000207 GET DOWN QUICK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000208 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000209 HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HOLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000210 YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000211 IT WAS HARASSMENT PURE AND SIMPLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000212 THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS CAPE AND THE BOY WAS STRUCK BY WHAT HE SAW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000213 HOW WAS THAT FOR A TIGHT SQUEEZE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000214 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000215 WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000216 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000217 GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SEASON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000218 THE DISPLAY WAS UNDERWHELMING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000219 NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FELLOWS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000220 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000221 THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000222 I'M GONNA BUILD AIR FIELDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000223 HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000224 A POX UPON ME FOR A CLUMSY THING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000225 STOVE'S HOTTER THAN I THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000226 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000227 THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000228 IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000229 YOU THINK IT'S EASY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000230 THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000231 I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000232 THE WIRELESS JOYPAD WAS EXPERIENCING CONNECTION ISSUES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000233 AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000234 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000235 IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000236 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000237 THAT'S WHY ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE NICE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000238 THIS IS A TRICK TO GET YOUR SYMPATHY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000239 IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000240 THE SHOP WAS BUSY AND THE MAN ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000241 SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000242 TONIGHT THEY WOULD FIND OUT THE TRUTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000243 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000244 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000245 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000246 HE HAD ASSUMED HE WOULD SOON RETURN TO HIS SHEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000247 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000248 NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000249 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000250 HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000251 I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000252 THIS IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION SHELDON SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000253 I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000254 IT ALL HAPPENED RATHER SUDDENLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000255 SURE SEE YOU THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000256 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000257 A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000258 HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000259 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000260 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000261 PATRICK HAS TERMINAL CANCER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000262 THIS IS JON DAVIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000263 THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000264 ONE AFTERNOON ONE OF HIS SERVANTS FELL ILL AND IT APPEARED THAT HE WOULD DIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000265 ACCORDING TO THE PREDOMINANT NOTION IN THE VATICAN CONDOMS SHOULDN'T BE USED IN SPITE OF HIV
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000266 BUT YOU ARE FORCING ME TO LOOK AT WEALTH AND AT HORIZONS I HAVE NEVER KNOWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000267 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000268 HE PAID FOR THE WOOL AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000269 THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000270 AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000271 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000272 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000273 I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000274 I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000275 MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000276 ARABS OFTEN APPEARED IN THE CITY SHOPPING AND CHANTING THEIR STRANGE PRAYERS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000277 THERE IS A REPTILE IN MY WESTERN SHOES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000278 HOW ARE YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000279 I WANT TO STAY AT THE OASIS THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000280 AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000281 WHAT'S IN THAT DESK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000282 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000283 I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000284 THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000285 SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000286 DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AT AN ABANDONED CHURCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000287 EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000288 BECAUSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WOULD FIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000289 IN HIS HEART HE WANTED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO SLEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000290 THE BOY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000291 THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000292 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000293 WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000294 THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000295 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000296 THE BOY SWORE THAT EVERY TIME HE HEARD THE ALARM HE WOULD HEED ITS MESSAGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000297 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000298 I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000299 WE CAN ONLY PERCEIVE A PART OF THE BROAD LIGHT SPECTRUM THE SUN EMITS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000300 THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000301 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000302 FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000303 I DON'T KNOW YOU FROM ADAM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000304 THEY WERE RACING DOWN THE STREETS WITH NO REGARD FOR ANYONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000305 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000306 IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000307 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000308 THERESA COULDN'T FEEL ANY MORE DUMB RIGHT NOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000309 HE'S ALLERGIC TO HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000310 I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET SOME STYLISH UNDERWEAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000311 THIRTY EVERY THURSDAY SIXTY AT SIXTY WHO KNOWS WHAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000312 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000313 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000314 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000315 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000316 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000317 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000318 THERE'S A LOT MORE YOU CAN DO WITH A TIGHTER INTEGRATION WITH THE EYE TRACKING API
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000319 HE KNEW WHAT I WAS THINKING THE BOY SAID TO HIMSELF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000320 WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO WRITE ABOUT HILLARY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000321 HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000322 JOHNATHAN ASSESSED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000323 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000324 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000325 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000326 HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THE STRANGE LAND HE WAS IN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000327 FROM THAT DAY ON IT WAS THE DESERT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000328 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000329 AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE MAN LIVED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000330 IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000331 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000332 IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELED BY FIREWOOD WITH A TRANSPARENT FLASK HEATING ON TOP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000333 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000334 SO IMMERSE YOURSELF IN IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000335 WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000336 BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000337 HIS NAME IS WELCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000338 THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000339 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000340 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000341 THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000342 THE MAN LOOKED AT THE ANGEL IN SURPRISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000343 BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000344 THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MORE TEA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000345 THAT WAS HIS WORK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000346 WHAT YOUR HUSBAND WAS MIXED UP IN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000347 THE BOY RECALLED THE BRILLIANCE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000348 IF I'M ON THE MARCH I JUST CONCENTRATE ON MARCHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000349 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000350 THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000351 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000352 IT'S THE ONLY ONE THEY HAD LEFT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000353 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000354 HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000355 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000356 THERE WAS NO OTHER BAGGAGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000357 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000358 DID YOU SAY A KING HE ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000359 WHAT HE SAID REMINDED THE BOY OF THE OLD KING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000360 BUT WE COULD SELL TEA IN CRYSTAL GLASSES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000361 HE WAS THINKING ABOUT OMENS AND SOMEONE HAD APPEARED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000362 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000363 IN THE DISCOTHEQUE THE DJ PLAYED PROGRESSIVE HOUSE MUSIC AND TRANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000364 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000365 I'VE WATCHED YOU GROW UP FROM A LITTLE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000366 IT'S THE ONLY NAME I'VE GOT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000367 THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000368 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000369 I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000370 IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000371 THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000372 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000373 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000374 BUT AS TIME PASSED TANGIER HAD CHANGED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000375 MY KEYCHAIN IS HEAVY AND AWKWARD TO CARRY IN MY POCKET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000376 I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000377 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000378 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000379 I KNOW THAT GIRL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000380 HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000381 BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000382 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000383 LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000384 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000385 HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000386 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000387 HOW COULD HE BE A FAKE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000388 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000389 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000390 ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000391 I FEEL LIKE A BOOTLEGGER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000392 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000393 THEN GET OUT OF HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000394 THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000395 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000396 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000397 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000398 YOU ALL KNOW ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000399 WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PLODDING THROUGH SOME USER INTERVIEWS AT THE MOMENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000400 I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THAT TUB
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000401 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000402 THIS DESERT WAS ONCE A SEA HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000403 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000404 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000405 HE HAD NO IDEA HOW HE WAS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000406 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000407 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000408 THAT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000409 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000410 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000411 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000412 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000413 SHE JOINED UP TOO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000414 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000415 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000416 THERE'S LIFE HERE THE BOY SAID TO THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000417 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000418 I'M GOING TO THEM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000419 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000420 IT BELONGS TO ME NOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000421 HAS HE BEEN HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000422 BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000423 YOU SAID YOU WANTED FIREWORKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000424 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000425 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000426 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000427 I WISH THEY WERE TOO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000428 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000429 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000430 THEY WERE ALWAYS JUST SOMEBODY TO FILL UP THE BLEACHERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000431 DONT FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE IT WOULD NOT HELP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000432 THERE WAS A SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE STATUE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000433 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000434 HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000435 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000436 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000437 NOBODY'S TRYING TO STEAL FROM YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000438 BUT HE FOUND IT MUCH MORE INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THE CARAVAN AND LISTEN TO THE WIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000439 IT CONSIDERS THE HORIZONTAL DIMENSION AS TIME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000440 HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000441 ALWAYS HEED THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000442 IT COMMENCED TO BLOW HARDER RAISING THE DESERT SANDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000443 WELL WHAT GOOD WOULD IT BE TO YOU IF YOU HAD T DIE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000444 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000445 CAROL SAVED HER BROTHER'S LIFE THAT DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000446 IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000447 THAT HE HAD ATTENDED A SEMINARY UNTIL HE WAS SIXTEEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000448 I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000449 KEEP HIM IN HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000450 MAYBE TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER THAN YESTERDAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000451 SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALEX PRETTY WELL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000452 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000453 WHEN THE SIMUM CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000454 THE FOREST BURNED FOR THIRTEEN DAYS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000455 WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000456 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000457 HE WASHED THE DETRITUS FROM HIS HAIR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000458 THAT'S WHAT ALCHEMISTS DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000459 HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000460 THE RESTAURANT WAS QUITE EXPENSIVE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000461 PHONE THE NEWSPAPERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000462 HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000463 HE AROSE AND TAKING UP HIS CROOK BEGAN TO AWAKEN THE SHEEP THAT STILL SLEPT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000464 THE SHEPHERD SWORE THAT HE WOULD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000465 AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000466 MAKTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000467 I DIDN'T FRISK HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000468 HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000469 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000470 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000471 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000472 I'M LEAVING TODAY SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000473 THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000474 I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000475 AND TOMORROW HIS ENEMY WOULD ALSO BE A PART OF THAT SOUL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000476 I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000477 SO THEN TRY HE SAID TO THE ENGLISHMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000478 I DON'T BELIEVE IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000479 THE VIRUS SPREAD FASTER THAN WILDFIRE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000480 THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000481 I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000482 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000483 PERHAPS SHE MET SOMEBODY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000484 TAKE YOUR PAWS OFF ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000485 APPLE PIE IS AN ICONIC DISH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000486 AM I GOING TO FIND MY TREASURE HE ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000487 THE ACHIEVED RESULTS ARE FAR BEHIND THE STATEOFTHEART IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000488 THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000489 COACH HAS HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000490 THE SUN WAS TURNED INTO A GOLDEN DISK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000491 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000492 THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000493 AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000494 IF HE ABANDONS THAT PURSUIT IT'S BECAUSE IT WASN'T TRUELOVE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000495 THE OASIS IS NEUTRAL GROUND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000496 WHAT DO YOU SAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000497 I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000498 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000499 SURE I KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000500 HE'S THE MAN THE ADS ARE WRITTEN FOR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000501 AND ABOVE ALL DON'T FORGET TO FOLLOW YOUR DESTINY THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000502 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000503 I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000504 WE WANT SOME ACTION IN THESE PICTURES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000505 SYMBOLS OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000506 THIS GUY STOLE MY WATCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000507 IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WINE HE HAD EVER TASTED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000508 IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000509 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000510 THE SPACE WAS SPARTAN ALMOST BARE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000511 DO YOU MIND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE CROWDED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000512 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000513 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000514 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000515 HE'S THE ONLY HUSBAND I'VE GOT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000516 THIS IS FOR YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000517 THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000518 HE NEVER ASKED ME TO SIT DOWN IN HIS LIFE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000519 MY NAME'S PETE DAVIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000520 PRETTY NICE NECK YOU'VE GOT THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000521 AN ARMY IS COMING THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000522 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000523 YOU MEAN HERE IN THE CITY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000524 REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOUR HEART IS THERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000525 REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOUR HEART IS THERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000526 I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000527 THE BOY APPROACHED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000528 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000529 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000530 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000531 HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000532 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000533 THE BOY FELT ILL AND TERRIBLY ALONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000534 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000535 WILL YOU EXCUSE US A MINUTE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000536 I'M LOVING IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000537 AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000538 YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000539 YOUR HEART IS ALIVE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000540 PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS VILLAGE SON SAID HIS FATHER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000541 AND THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY WELL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000542 VICTORIA DOES THINGS IN A MUCH BIGGER WAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000543 I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000544 I'D HATE TO HAVE THAT MANY PINS STUCK IN ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000545 BUT WHAT'S ALL THIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000546 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000547 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000548 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000549 HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000550 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000551 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000552 WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000553 HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000554 DOESNT IT DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF HASHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000555 AND THAT HE A BOY COULD PERFORM MIRACLES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000556 IT WON'T HURT YOU AND WE CAN MAKE THE CITY EDITION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000557 THE NAVY'S GOING TO FLY FATHER HOME THIS AFTERNOON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000558 HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000559 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000560 WE ATE SPICY RICE WITH CHICKEN LEGS AND WHITE MUSHROOMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000561 THE HEAT LASTED UNTIL NIGHTFALL AND ALL THAT TIME HE HAD TO CARRY HIS JACKET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000562 AND I'LL SIGN A PAPER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000563 THAT'S AN INHERENT DISADVANTAGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000564 I'D BETTER HUSTLE HIM UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000565 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000566 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000567 I'M AFRAID SHE'D FEEL ASHAMED TO THINK SHE HADN'T TRUSTED YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000568 BUT I'M GOING TO EGYPT THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000569 WHAT WERE YOU WHEN YOU CAME HERE FIVE YEARS AGO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000570 I GOT IT BACK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000571 I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000572 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000573 FASTFOOD IS CONVENIENT BUT OFTEN UNHEALTHY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000574 HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE MORNING'S MEETING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000575 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000576 THE NEARBY CITY OF CEUTA HAD GROWN FASTER THAN TANGIER AND BUSINESS HAD FALLEN OFF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000577 HE'S DEPOSITED TEN DOLLARS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000578 ONLY US EXPLORERS CAN GET IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000579 JUST A MEMORY RIGHT NOW IT SIGNIFIED SHADE WATER AND A REFUGE FROM THE WAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000580 THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000581 DIDN'T I TELL YOU NEVER TO COME PANHANDLING AROUND HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000582 THIS WILL HELP YOU EFFECTIVELY COLLABORATE WITH DEVELOPERS AND COORDINATE CROSSTEAM PROJECTS THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000583 BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000584 BUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT HAD NO CHOICE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000585 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000586 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000587 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000588 THE MAN WEPT WITH HAPPINESS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000589 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000590 COME IN AGAIN SOME TIME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000591 RAISINS ARE DELICIOUS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000592 HE WANTED YOUR MONEY HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000593 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000594 MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000595 YOU MUSTN'T LET WHAT SHE SAID BOTHER YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000596 SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME THE SUN ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000597 HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU GET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000598 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000599 HOW DO I GUESS AT THE FUTURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000600 LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000601 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000602 DON'T MIND THE COLONEL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000603 HE THOUGHT OF ALL THE MARRIED SHEPHERDS HE HAD KNOWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000604 I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000605 AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000606 WHAT IS A FOREIGNER DOING HERE ASKED ANOTHER OF THE MEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000607 AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000608 THERE'S THAT REPRIEVE IF THEY EVER FIND OUT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000609 THREE DAYS FROM NOW HE WOULD BE WITH THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000610 IF YOU DON'T STOP FOLLOWING ME I'LL CALL THE POLICE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000611 BUT MAYBE PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT WAY HAD NEVER LEARNED THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000612 BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000613 LOOKS LIKE ABOUT TEN YEARS A PIECE FOR YOU BIRDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000614 HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000615 THE OTHER SON WAS A POET AND DELIGHTED ALL OF ROME WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL VERSES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000616 HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000617 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000618 ONE MUST PREPARE FOR IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000619 BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUMNI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000620 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000621 IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000622 A MAN DOESN'T GET IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS EVERY DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000623 CAN I GET A WOOT WOOT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000624 I THINK IT'S ABOUT BIRD HUNTING BUT NOW I CAN SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000625 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000626 SUNBURNS CAN BE AVOIDED BY APPLYING SUNSCREEN OR BY STAYING IN THE SHADOWS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000627 IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000628 IF HE EVER DECIDED TO LEAVE THEM THEY WOULD SUFFER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000629 TAKE CHARGE OF HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000630 I LOST MY WALLET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000631 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000632 HE'S NUTS ABOUT YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000633 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000634 I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRANSMITTED BY WORD OF MOUTH HE THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000635 IT'S THE OTHER FOREIGNER THE ENGLISHMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000636 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000637 THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOSED OFF THE CONVERSATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000638 YOU'LL NEVER GET IT OUT OF ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000639 IT WAS THE PURE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000640 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000641 I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000642 I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CHANGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000643 IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000644 THEY WENT TO THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE MONASTERY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000645 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000646 IF WHAT ONE FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTER IT WILL NEVER SPOIL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000647 WILL I LEARN TO DO THAT SOMEDAY THE BOY ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000648 THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000649 HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000650 BY THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION I SAW THEM STAGGERING AND FALLING AND THEIR SUPPORTERS TURNING TO RUN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000651 AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000652 IT HAD TOLD HIM TO DIG WHERE HIS TEARS FELL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000653 HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000654 MOHAMMED IS A WONDERFUL GUITAR PLAYER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000655 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000656 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000657 A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000658 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000659 LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000660 THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000661 AND HE KNEW WHAT WAS THE FAIR PRICE FOR EVERY ONE OF HIS ANIMALS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000662 MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000663 MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000664 THEY'RE CALLING TO US NOT TO GIVE UP AND TO KEEP ON FIGHTING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000665 IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000666 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000667 OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000668 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000669 I'M GOING TO THEM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000670 I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000671 SUNBURNS CAN BE AVOIDED BY APPLYING SUNSCREEN OR BY STAYING IN THE SHADOWS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000672 THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000673 AND THE LAST ONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000674 A LOT OF MONEY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000675 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000676 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000677 I SAID I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000678 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000679 I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000680 ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE EVERY LIE HE TELLS YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000681 THERE WAS A HOLE THERE AMONG THE STONES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000682 LICORICE IS A BLACK CHEWY FOOD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000683 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000684 THE SHEEP FIDGETED NEARBY UNEASY WITH THEIR NEW OWNER AND EXCITED BY SO MUCH CHANGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000685 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000686 HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000687 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000688 THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000689 I DIDN'T COME HERE TO HAVE YOU READ MY PALM HE SAID ALREADY REGRETTING HAVING COME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000690 I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT MY HORIZON HAS EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000691 IT SORT OF MAKES A FELLOW LOSE FAITH IN HIMSELF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000692 THOSE GYPSIES ARE REALLY SMART HE THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000693 DO I LOOK AS FUNNY AS YOU DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000694 BUT I'M LIABLE TO GET INTO A JAM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000695 ALL THE VILLAGERS CHEERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000696 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000697 THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000698 THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000699 YOU BROUGHT A NEW FEELING INTO MY CRYSTAL SHOP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000700 THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000701 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000702 BECAUSE HE WAS TERRIFIED THE BOY DIDN'T ANSWER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000703 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000704 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000705 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000706 IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000707 WHAT GOOD IS MONEY TO YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000708 THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000709 SORT OF A JACK LONDON STYLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000710 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000711 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000712 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000713 BUT HE GRANTED THE TRAVELERS THREE DAYS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000714 WELL THEN HELP ME DO THAT THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000715 I AM HERE THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000716 THE ARROW WAS POINTING TO THE EXIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000717 I'M GOING TO GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE DESERT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000718 DO YOU SEE THIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000719 THEY WERE TRIBESMEN DRESSED IN BLUE WITH BLACK RINGS SURROUNDING THEIR TURBANS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000720 THE LIBRARY IS OPEN TO EVERYONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000721 THAT'S COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000722 IT WAS A TENT LIKE MANY AT THE OASIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000723 HE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE PRACTICAL MATTERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000724 SHE WROTE THE STUFF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000725 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000726 THE HOOKAHS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUARDS STOOD AT ATTENTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000727 ANOTHER WHO WAS SEARCHING THE BOY'S BAGS FOUND THE PIECE OF GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000728 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000729 I NEVER SAW AMANDA ACT LIKE THAT BEFORE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000730 THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO COOL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000731 OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000732 FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000733 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000734 BECAUSE NOW HE KNEW WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000735 DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET HIDING PLACE HERE IN THE HOUSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000736 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000737 I'M GOING TO NEED IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000738 I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000739 I BET YOU FORGOT THE WINE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000740 NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000741 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000742 THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000743 AS HE WAS LEAVING HE SAW IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM HIS OLD SHEPHERD'S POUCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000744 IS THERE A MRS JOSHUA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000745 I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000746 YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000747 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000748 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000749 THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000750 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000751 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000752 THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000753 WHAT TRICKS WOULD I PULL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000754 THIS SOLUTION ALSO WORKS WELL IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL A LINUX DISTRO ON WINDOWS VIA VIRTUALIZATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000755 BECAUSE FOR HIM YOU ARE A GREEN FIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000756 DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000757 IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000758 BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000759 FEBRUARY TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000760 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000761 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000762 THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000763 UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000764 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000765 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ROMANTIC
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000766 THE FOOTBALL JOCKS LAUGHED VICIOUSLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000767 YOU'RE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000768 THE ELEVATORS ARE STILL RUNNING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000769 BUT USE THEM TO BUY YOUR FLOCK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000770 THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000771 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000772 BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000773 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000774 THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000775 HAVE YOU GOT A MIRROR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000776 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000777 THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000778 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000779 THE PILOTS BRACED THEMSELVES FOR IMPACT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000780 IT WAS A A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000781 LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000782 HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000783 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000784 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000785 HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000786 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000787 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000788 I CAN EXPLAIN IF YOU'LL JUST LISTEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000789 THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000790 IT'S NOT A LIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000791 IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000792 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000793 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000794 NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000795 HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000796 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000797 JUST AS A RULE OF THUMB
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000798 I REALLY DID IT QUITE BRILLIANTLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000799 AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000800 GET ME WALTER BURNS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000801 HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000802 PEOPLE CONTINUED TO COME AND GO FROM THE BAKER'S SHOP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000803 THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000804 YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000805 WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000806 FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000807 I WISH YOU'D FORGET ABOUT US
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000808 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000809 THE BOOK THAT MOST INTERESTED THE BOY TOLD THE STORIES OF THE FAMOUS ALCHEMISTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000810 ARE YOU CRAZY THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000811 THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000812 MY ALLERGY HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE TODAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000813 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING AND LOAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000814 BEEN SEEING ME IN YOUR DREAMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000815 THE STRANGER WITHDREW THE SWORD FROM THE BOY'S FOREHEAD AND THE BOY FELT IMMENSELY RELIEVED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000816 SHE NEVER GREW UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000817 THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000818 FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000819 MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000820 SAME WAY YOU DID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000821 THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000822 WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000823 AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000824 I WANT THOSE STAMPS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000825 I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000826 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000827 THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000828 MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000829 BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000830 YOU WILL NEVER REOPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000831 YOU DONT COMPARE DIRECTLY TO EXISTING STATEOFTHEART METHODS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000832 BUT HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DESIRE THAT AN ARMY INVADE THE OASIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000833 I'M SMOKING TOO MUCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000834 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000835 AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000836 THE TEA SEEMED LESS BITTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000837 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000838 NOT TO WORRY SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000839 EARLIER THIS YEAR WE FOUND A REALLY NICE PLACE NEAR MY OFFICE AND WE MOVED IN TOGETHER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000840 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000841 THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000842 WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000843 TWO DAYS AGO YOU SAID THAT I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TRAVEL THE MERCHANT ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000844 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000845 HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS WERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000846 MECCA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000847 THAT NIGHT HE TOLD ALL OF THIS TO THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000848 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000849 FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000850 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000851 THE ALCHEMIST ERASED THE CIRCLE IN THE SAND AND THE SNAKE SLITHERED AWAY AMONG THE ROCKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000852 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000853 I'M AFRAID THE JOKE'S ON US
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000854 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000855 THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000856 THE BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS A SURPRISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000857 THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000858 YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000859 AND WHAT A WAY TO QUIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000860 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000861 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000862 AND STOP THREATENING THAT BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000863 THEN HE TURNED TO THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000864 FOR USERS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY CAN TRUST THEIR OPERATING SYSTEM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000865 WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO TO MECCA NOW ASKED THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000866 THE MONK WAS IRRITATED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000867 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000868 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000869 CAN'T YOU READ ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000870 ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE BOY THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000871 DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000872 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000873 THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000874 HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000875 WILL YOU GIVE ME THOSE STAMPS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000876 I LEFT HER HANGING AROUND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000877 HE HAD BEEN TO THE VILLAGE ONLY ONCE THE YEAR BEFORE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000878 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000879 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000880 WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000881 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000882 LOOK AT THOSE SHOULDERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000883 THE SUN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000884 SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000885 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000886 I WILL BE BACK SOON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000887 WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000888 MRS SARAH DOESN'T EITHER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000889 WELLI DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000890 HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000891 I THOUGHT YOU WERE CHASING ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000892 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000893 NOTE THAT IT DOES HAVE BUILTIN SUPPORT FOR WEB BROWSING ALTHOUGH I FIND IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000894 THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000895 THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT SORTS OF FUEL AT THIS GAS STATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000896 I GOTTA FIGURE SOME WAY OUT OF THIS THING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000897 IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000898 THIS BEHAVIOR OF NEURAL NETWORKS IS SOMETIMES CALLED DREAMING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000899 DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000900 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000901 THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000902 THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000903 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000904 ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000905 I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE HIM SINCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000906 I'M AFRAID I MIGHT HAVE SOILED THE COUCH A LITTLE WITH MY SHOES EDDIE MURPHY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000907 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000908 THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SO DID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000909 WHO TOLD YOU THAT ASKED THE BOY STARTLED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000910 HE DECIDED TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000911 MY FATHER OFFERED HER A JOB
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000912 IT WAS PAPA THAT SENDS YOU FLOWERS EVERY DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000913 ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000914 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000915 I JUMPED IN TO SAVE RACHEL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000916 THAT'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000917 IS THE HEAD BETTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000918 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000919 THAT WOMAN IS GONNA BE ON THAT ROOF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000920 I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000921 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000922 HE RECITED AN OUR FATHER SILENTLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000923 THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000924 AND HERE'S A KISS FOR YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000925 WHO WROTE THAT SPEECH FOR YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000926 SAVE THAT FOR THE TRIBUNE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000927 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000928 SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000929 I DON'T LIKE SEALS ANYHOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000930 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000931 AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000932 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO LEARN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000933 YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000934 THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000935 THE SHIP APPEARED TO BE CONSTRUCTED WITH SOME FORM OF CHROMIUM EXOSKELETON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000936 NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECKPOINTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000937 IT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT GUARANTEES EVERYONE'S FREEDOM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000938 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000939 A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000940 MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000941 YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAY DIE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000942 THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000943 THEN A MAN APPROACHED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000944 BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000945 AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000946 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY ALWAYS STAY CLOSE TO ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000947 I'M AN ALCHEMIST SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M AN ALCHEMIST HE SAID AS HE PREPARED THE MEAL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000948 JENNIFER'S EXPRESSION CHANGED PULL MY FINGER SHE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000949 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000950 THE OLD MAN LEAFED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000951 I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000952 AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000953 THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000954 RELAXED AND UNHURRIED HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD WALK THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF TANGIER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000955 THE MEETING WAS OVER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000956 ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000957 THAT WASN'T AT ALL NECESSARY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000958 I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000959 WHEN HE EMERGED IT WAS WITH A YOUNG ARAB DRESSED IN WHITE AND GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000960 WERE THEY QUICK OR WERE THEY ENRAGED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000961 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000962 AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000963 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE IN HIS HEART THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO DO SO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000964 THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000965 BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TWICE WILL SURELY HAPPEN A THIRD TIME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000966 AND THIS IS WHAT YOUR SON SAID THE ANGEL TOLD THE MAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000967 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000968 WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000969 IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000970 HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000971 YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000972 IF IT WOULD SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000973 HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000974 THEY WERE ALL FURIOUS WHEN THE ESCAPADE FAILED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000975 IT ALWAYS HELPS TO BE LEARNING SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000976 WHERE ARE YOU BOUND ASKED THE YOUNG ARAB
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000977 AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000978 I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000979 I'M NOT AFRAID OF FAILING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000980 SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000981 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000982 ANY DOPE YET ON HOW HE GOT OUT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000983 THEY'RE NOT FOR SALE HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000984 THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000985 MIND IF I SIT DOWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000986 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000987 HE HAD STUDIED LATIN SPANISH AND THEOLOGY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000988 MR BEAN IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF A BRITISH COMEDY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000989 THE IDEAS SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN A MORE CONCISE AND DIRECT MANNER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000990 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000991 I'M GOING TO CHECK UP ON THAT RIGHT AWAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000992 BUTMAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000993 I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000994 EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000995 IT WAS ENGINEERING AT ITS FINEST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000996 ALL THINGS ARE ONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000997 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000998 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000999 HOW ABOUT ONCE MORE AROUND THE PARK
