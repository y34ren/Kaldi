sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000175 GET SOME WATER QUICKLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000176 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000177 THERE WAS A LOUD SHRIEK FROM A WOMAN STANDING BEHIND US
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000178 THEN LEAVE WITH THE CARAVAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000179 HE IS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND JUST TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000180 YOU'RE STILL A GOOD REPORTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000181 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000182 THERE ISN'T ANY MORE WINE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000183 DOES THIS BELONG TO YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000184 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000185 THEY WANTED TO SAVE THE OASIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000186 TWO HORSEMEN WAITING AHEAD OF THEM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000187 I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000188 I DON'T MUCH LIKE CHANGE HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000189 THE DUNES ARE CHANGED BY THE WIND BUT THE DESERT NEVER CHANGES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000190 SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000191 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000192 HE'S IN MY ROOM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000193 IS SHE AS GOOD AS YOU SAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000194 THEY FILLED THREE SACKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000195 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000196 THIS IS THE MORNING POST YOU'RE TALKING TO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000197 YOU WILL SPEND THAT HOUR GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH MARSHALL BAILEY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000198 THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000199 IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000200 THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000201 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000202 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000203 I KNOW ITS DIMENSIONS AND HOW IT BEHAVES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000204 OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000205 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000206 TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000207 GET DOWN QUICK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000208 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000209 HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HOLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000210 YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000211 IT WAS HARASSMENT PURE AND SIMPLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000212 THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS CAPE AND THE BOY WAS STRUCK BY WHAT HE SAW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000213 HOW WAS THAT FOR A TIGHT SQUEEZE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000214 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000215 WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000216 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000217 GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SEASON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000218 THE DISPLAY WAS UNDERWHELMING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000219 NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FELLOWS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000220 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000221 THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000222 I'M GONNA BUILD AIR FIELDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000223 HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000224 A POX UPON ME FOR A CLUMSY THING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000225 STOVE'S HOTTER THAN I THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000226 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000227 THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000228 IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000229 YOU THINK IT'S EASY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000230 THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000231 I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000232 THE WIRELESS JOYPAD WAS EXPERIENCING CONNECTION ISSUES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000233 AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000234 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000235 IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000236 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000237 THAT'S WHY ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE NICE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000238 THIS IS A TRICK TO GET YOUR SYMPATHY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000239 IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000240 THE SHOP WAS BUSY AND THE MAN ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000241 SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000242 TONIGHT THEY WOULD FIND OUT THE TRUTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000243 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000244 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000245 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000246 HE HAD ASSUMED HE WOULD SOON RETURN TO HIS SHEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000247 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000248 NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000249 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
