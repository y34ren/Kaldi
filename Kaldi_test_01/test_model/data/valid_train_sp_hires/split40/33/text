sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000400 I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THAT TUB
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000401 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000402 THIS DESERT WAS ONCE A SEA HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000403 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000404 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000405 HE HAD NO IDEA HOW HE WAS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000406 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000407 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000408 THAT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000409 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000410 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000411 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000412 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000413 SHE JOINED UP TOO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000414 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000415 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000416 THERE'S LIFE HERE THE BOY SAID TO THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000417 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000418 I'M GOING TO THEM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000419 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000420 IT BELONGS TO ME NOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000421 HAS HE BEEN HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000422 BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000423 YOU SAID YOU WANTED FIREWORKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000424 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000425 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000426 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000427 I WISH THEY WERE TOO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000428 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000429 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000430 THEY WERE ALWAYS JUST SOMEBODY TO FILL UP THE BLEACHERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000431 DONT FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE IT WOULD NOT HELP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000432 THERE WAS A SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE STATUE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000433 THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000434 HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000435 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000436 IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000437 NOBODY'S TRYING TO STEAL FROM YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000438 BUT HE FOUND IT MUCH MORE INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THE CARAVAN AND LISTEN TO THE WIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000439 IT CONSIDERS THE HORIZONTAL DIMENSION AS TIME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000440 HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000441 ALWAYS HEED THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000442 IT COMMENCED TO BLOW HARDER RAISING THE DESERT SANDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000443 WELL WHAT GOOD WOULD IT BE TO YOU IF YOU HAD T DIE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000444 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000445 CAROL SAVED HER BROTHER'S LIFE THAT DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000446 IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000447 THAT HE HAD ATTENDED A SEMINARY UNTIL HE WAS SIXTEEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000448 I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000449 KEEP HIM IN HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000450 MAYBE TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER THAN YESTERDAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000451 SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALEX PRETTY WELL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000452 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000453 WHEN THE SIMUM CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000454 THE FOREST BURNED FOR THIRTEEN DAYS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000455 WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000456 I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000457 HE WASHED THE DETRITUS FROM HIS HAIR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000458 THAT'S WHAT ALCHEMISTS DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000459 HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000460 THE RESTAURANT WAS QUITE EXPENSIVE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000461 PHONE THE NEWSPAPERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000462 HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000463 HE AROSE AND TAKING UP HIS CROOK BEGAN TO AWAKEN THE SHEEP THAT STILL SLEPT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000464 THE SHEPHERD SWORE THAT HE WOULD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000465 AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000466 MAKTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000467 I DIDN'T FRISK HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000468 HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000469 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000470 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000471 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000472 I'M LEAVING TODAY SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000473 THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000474 I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
