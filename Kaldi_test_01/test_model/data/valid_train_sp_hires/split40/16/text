sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000125 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000126 YOU'RE A WEEK LATE FOR SCHOOL ALREADY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000127 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000128 YOU HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR DREAMS ABOUT THE OLD KING AND YOUR TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000129 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000130 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000131 THE LEVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000132 WITH THE GIRL WITH THE RAVEN HAIR HIS DAYS WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000133 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000134 WEAR THE BLUE ONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000135 LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOURLEAF CLOVERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000136 I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000137 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000138 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000139 THE TWO WALKED OUT AMONG THE PALMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000140 HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000141 THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000142 MEN HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS OF THE WISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000143 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000144 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000145 GET THE BULLETIN BOARD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000146 THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000147 YOU TOLD ME THAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000148 NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000149 DO YOU WANT TO WAKE THAT BABY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000150 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000151 I NEVER STOLE A WATCH IN MY LIFE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000152 GOOD LUCK TO YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000153 MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000154 I WAS JUST ASKING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000155 LET HIM HAVE EVERYTHING HE WANTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000156 THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000157 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000158 EGYPT IS A COUNTRY THAT IS OFTEN MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000159 HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000160 THE BOY KNEW AND WAS NOW WORKING TOWARD IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000161 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000162 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000163 THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000164 IT IS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000165 THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000166 WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000167 THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000168 THE ALARM CLOCK WAS SET FOR TWENTY PAST THREE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000169 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000170 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000171 THE BOY WENT TO THE WELL EVERY DAY TO MEET WITH FATIMA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000172 IT'S THE NAME OF THE PROPHET'S DAUGHTER FATIMA SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000173 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000174 THE BOY REMEMBERED HIS DREAM AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR TO HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000175 GET SOME WATER QUICKLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000176 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000177 THERE WAS A LOUD SHRIEK FROM A WOMAN STANDING BEHIND US
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000178 THEN LEAVE WITH THE CARAVAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000179 HE IS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND JUST TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000180 YOU'RE STILL A GOOD REPORTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000181 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000182 THERE ISN'T ANY MORE WINE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000183 DOES THIS BELONG TO YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000184 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000185 THEY WANTED TO SAVE THE OASIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000186 TWO HORSEMEN WAITING AHEAD OF THEM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000187 I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000188 I DON'T MUCH LIKE CHANGE HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000189 THE DUNES ARE CHANGED BY THE WIND BUT THE DESERT NEVER CHANGES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000190 SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000191 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000192 HE'S IN MY ROOM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000193 IS SHE AS GOOD AS YOU SAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000194 THEY FILLED THREE SACKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000195 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000196 THIS IS THE MORNING POST YOU'RE TALKING TO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000197 YOU WILL SPEND THAT HOUR GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH MARSHALL BAILEY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000198 THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000199 IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
