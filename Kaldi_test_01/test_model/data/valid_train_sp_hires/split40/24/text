sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000725 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000726 THE HOOKAHS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUARDS STOOD AT ATTENTION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000727 ANOTHER WHO WAS SEARCHING THE BOY'S BAGS FOUND THE PIECE OF GOLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000728 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000729 I NEVER SAW AMANDA ACT LIKE THAT BEFORE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000730 THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO COOL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000731 OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000732 FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000733 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000734 BECAUSE NOW HE KNEW WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000735 DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET HIDING PLACE HERE IN THE HOUSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000736 YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN ANYTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000737 I'M GOING TO NEED IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000738 I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000739 I BET YOU FORGOT THE WINE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000740 NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000741 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000742 THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000743 AS HE WAS LEAVING HE SAW IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM HIS OLD SHEPHERD'S POUCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000744 IS THERE A MRS JOSHUA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000745 I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000746 YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000747 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000748 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000749 THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000750 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000751 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000752 THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000753 WHAT TRICKS WOULD I PULL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000754 THIS SOLUTION ALSO WORKS WELL IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL A LINUX DISTRO ON WINDOWS VIA VIRTUALIZATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000755 BECAUSE FOR HIM YOU ARE A GREEN FIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000756 DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000757 IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000758 BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000759 FEBRUARY TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000760 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000761 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000762 THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000763 UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000764 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000765 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ROMANTIC
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000766 THE FOOTBALL JOCKS LAUGHED VICIOUSLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000767 YOU'RE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000768 THE ELEVATORS ARE STILL RUNNING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000769 BUT USE THEM TO BUY YOUR FLOCK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000770 THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000771 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000772 BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000773 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000774 THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000775 HAVE YOU GOT A MIRROR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000776 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000777 THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000778 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000779 THE PILOTS BRACED THEMSELVES FOR IMPACT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000780 IT WAS A A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000781 LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000782 HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000783 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000784 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000785 HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000786 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000787 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000788 I CAN EXPLAIN IF YOU'LL JUST LISTEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000789 THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000790 IT'S NOT A LIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000791 IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000792 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000793 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000794 NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000795 HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000796 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000797 JUST AS A RULE OF THUMB
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000798 I REALLY DID IT QUITE BRILLIANTLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000799 AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
