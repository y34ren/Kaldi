sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000650 BY THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION I SAW THEM STAGGERING AND FALLING AND THEIR SUPPORTERS TURNING TO RUN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000651 AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000652 IT HAD TOLD HIM TO DIG WHERE HIS TEARS FELL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000653 HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000654 MOHAMMED IS A WONDERFUL GUITAR PLAYER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000655 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000656 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000657 A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000658 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000659 LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000660 THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000661 AND HE KNEW WHAT WAS THE FAIR PRICE FOR EVERY ONE OF HIS ANIMALS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000662 MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000663 MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000664 THEY'RE CALLING TO US NOT TO GIVE UP AND TO KEEP ON FIGHTING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000665 IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000666 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000667 OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000668 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000669 I'M GOING TO THEM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000670 I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000671 SUNBURNS CAN BE AVOIDED BY APPLYING SUNSCREEN OR BY STAYING IN THE SHADOWS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000672 THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000673 AND THE LAST ONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000674 A LOT OF MONEY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000675 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000676 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000677 I SAID I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000678 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000679 I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000680 ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE EVERY LIE HE TELLS YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000681 THERE WAS A HOLE THERE AMONG THE STONES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000682 LICORICE IS A BLACK CHEWY FOOD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000683 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000684 THE SHEEP FIDGETED NEARBY UNEASY WITH THEIR NEW OWNER AND EXCITED BY SO MUCH CHANGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000685 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000686 HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000687 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000688 THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000689 I DIDN'T COME HERE TO HAVE YOU READ MY PALM HE SAID ALREADY REGRETTING HAVING COME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000690 I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT MY HORIZON HAS EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000691 IT SORT OF MAKES A FELLOW LOSE FAITH IN HIMSELF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000692 THOSE GYPSIES ARE REALLY SMART HE THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000693 DO I LOOK AS FUNNY AS YOU DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000694 BUT I'M LIABLE TO GET INTO A JAM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000695 ALL THE VILLAGERS CHEERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000696 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000697 THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000698 THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000699 YOU BROUGHT A NEW FEELING INTO MY CRYSTAL SHOP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000700 THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000701 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000702 BECAUSE HE WAS TERRIFIED THE BOY DIDN'T ANSWER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000703 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000704 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000705 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000706 IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000707 WHAT GOOD IS MONEY TO YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000708 THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000709 SORT OF A JACK LONDON STYLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000710 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000711 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000712 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000713 BUT HE GRANTED THE TRAVELERS THREE DAYS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000714 WELL THEN HELP ME DO THAT THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000715 I AM HERE THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000716 THE ARROW WAS POINTING TO THE EXIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000717 I'M GOING TO GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE DESERT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000718 DO YOU SEE THIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000719 THEY WERE TRIBESMEN DRESSED IN BLUE WITH BLACK RINGS SURROUNDING THEIR TURBANS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000720 THE LIBRARY IS OPEN TO EVERYONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000721 THAT'S COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000722 IT WAS A TENT LIKE MANY AT THE OASIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000723 HE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE PRACTICAL MATTERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000724 SHE WROTE THE STUFF
