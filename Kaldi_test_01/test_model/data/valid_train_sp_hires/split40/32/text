sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000325 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000326 HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THE STRANGE LAND HE WAS IN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000327 FROM THAT DAY ON IT WAS THE DESERT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000328 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000329 AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE MAN LIVED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000330 IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000331 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000332 IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELED BY FIREWOOD WITH A TRANSPARENT FLASK HEATING ON TOP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000333 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000334 SO IMMERSE YOURSELF IN IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000335 WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000336 BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000337 HIS NAME IS WELCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000338 THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000339 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000340 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000341 THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000342 THE MAN LOOKED AT THE ANGEL IN SURPRISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000343 BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000344 THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MORE TEA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000345 THAT WAS HIS WORK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000346 WHAT YOUR HUSBAND WAS MIXED UP IN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000347 THE BOY RECALLED THE BRILLIANCE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000348 IF I'M ON THE MARCH I JUST CONCENTRATE ON MARCHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000349 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000350 THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000351 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000352 IT'S THE ONLY ONE THEY HAD LEFT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000353 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000354 HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000355 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000356 THERE WAS NO OTHER BAGGAGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000357 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000358 DID YOU SAY A KING HE ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000359 WHAT HE SAID REMINDED THE BOY OF THE OLD KING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000360 BUT WE COULD SELL TEA IN CRYSTAL GLASSES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000361 HE WAS THINKING ABOUT OMENS AND SOMEONE HAD APPEARED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000362 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000363 IN THE DISCOTHEQUE THE DJ PLAYED PROGRESSIVE HOUSE MUSIC AND TRANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000364 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000365 I'VE WATCHED YOU GROW UP FROM A LITTLE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000366 IT'S THE ONLY NAME I'VE GOT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000367 THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000368 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000369 I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000370 IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000371 THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000372 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000373 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000374 BUT AS TIME PASSED TANGIER HAD CHANGED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000375 MY KEYCHAIN IS HEAVY AND AWKWARD TO CARRY IN MY POCKET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000376 I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000377 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000378 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000379 I KNOW THAT GIRL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000380 HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000381 BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000382 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000383 LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000384 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000385 HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000386 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000387 HOW COULD HE BE A FAKE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000388 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000389 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000390 ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000391 I FEEL LIKE A BOOTLEGGER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000392 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000393 THEN GET OUT OF HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000394 THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000395 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000396 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000397 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000398 YOU ALL KNOW ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000399 WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PLODDING THROUGH SOME USER INTERVIEWS AT THE MOMENT
