cv-valid-train-sample-000075 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000076 HE DIDN'T NEED TO DEMONSTRATE HIS SCIENCE AND ART TO ANYONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000077 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000078 BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOVE
cv-valid-train-sample-000079 BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
cv-valid-train-sample-000080 WHY DO YOU WANT TO FIND THAT SORT OF PERSON THE ARAB ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000081 THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
cv-valid-train-sample-000082 HOW DO YOU HANDLE THE NEGATIVE WEIGHTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000083 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
cv-valid-train-sample-000084 AND ALSO BY UNHAPPINESS ENVY AND JEALOUSY
cv-valid-train-sample-000085 TO CALIBRATE THE MOTION CAPTURING SYSTEM PLEASE DO A TPOSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000086 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
cv-valid-train-sample-000087 THE ALCHEMIST FOLLOWED AS THE BOY'S HORSE RAN FOR ALMOST HALF AN HOUR
cv-valid-train-sample-000088 ALL THIS HAPPENED BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNSET THE BOY THOUGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000089 SHALL I PUT A LITTLE RUM IN THE COFFEE
cv-valid-train-sample-000090 TO NOURISH THE FALCON
cv-valid-train-sample-000091 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT

cv-valid-train-sample-000093 HELP MY FRIEND MR RICHARD
cv-valid-train-sample-000094 WANT TO WALK TO NEW YORK
cv-valid-train-sample-000095 DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE
cv-valid-train-sample-000096 I DIDN'T FALL IN
cv-valid-train-sample-000097 IT'S LATE IN THE EVENING A PERFECT TIME FOR COFFEE
cv-valid-train-sample-000098 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000099 THE BOSS SENT ME OVER WITH IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000100 HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
cv-valid-train-sample-000101 THE FUMES FROM THE TRAFFIC WAS UNBEARABLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000102 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
cv-valid-train-sample-000103 THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
cv-valid-train-sample-000104 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
cv-valid-train-sample-000105 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY APPARENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000106 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000107 THE ENGLISHMAN HAD SEVERAL SUITCASES FILLED WITH BOOKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000108 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
cv-valid-train-sample-000109 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
cv-valid-train-sample-000110 WISH I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS
cv-valid-train-sample-000111 HE STILL CALLS HIS MOTHER MUMMY
cv-valid-train-sample-000112 IT'S COMMON TO RUN INTO PROBLEMS SO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000113 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000114 THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000115 HARRY'LL TEAR HIS DINNER SUIT
cv-valid-train-sample-000116 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000117 YOU'VE GOT HIS GUN
cv-valid-train-sample-000118 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
cv-valid-train-sample-000119 IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT IT MATTERS A LOT
cv-valid-train-sample-000120 WE MUST BE GOOD
cv-valid-train-sample-000121 WATCH OVER HER TONIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000122 DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE
cv-valid-train-sample-000123 THERE'S A MOON OUT TONIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000124 THE BOY REPEATED HIS QUESTION
cv-valid-train-sample-000125 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000126 YOU'RE A WEEK LATE FOR SCHOOL ALREADY
cv-valid-train-sample-000127 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
cv-valid-train-sample-000128 YOU HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR DREAMS ABOUT THE OLD KING AND YOUR TREASURE
cv-valid-train-sample-000129 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
cv-valid-train-sample-000130 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000131 THE LEVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
cv-valid-train-sample-000132 WITH THE GIRL WITH THE RAVEN HAIR HIS DAYS WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000133 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
cv-valid-train-sample-000134 WEAR THE BLUE ONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000135 LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOURLEAF CLOVERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000136 I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000137 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000138 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000139 THE TWO WALKED OUT AMONG THE PALMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000140 HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000141 THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000142 MEN HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS OF THE WISE
cv-valid-train-sample-000143 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000144 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
