sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000666 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000667 OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN

sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000677 I SAID I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000678 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000679 I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
