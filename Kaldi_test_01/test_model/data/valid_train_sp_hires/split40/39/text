sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000850 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000851 THE ALCHEMIST ERASED THE CIRCLE IN THE SAND AND THE SNAKE SLITHERED AWAY AMONG THE ROCKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000852 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000853 I'M AFRAID THE JOKE'S ON US
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000854 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000855 THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000856 THE BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS A SURPRISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000857 THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000858 YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000859 AND WHAT A WAY TO QUIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000860 THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000861 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000862 AND STOP THREATENING THAT BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000863 THEN HE TURNED TO THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000864 FOR USERS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY CAN TRUST THEIR OPERATING SYSTEM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000865 WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO TO MECCA NOW ASKED THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000866 THE MONK WAS IRRITATED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000867 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000868 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000869 CAN'T YOU READ ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000870 ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE BOY THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000871 DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000872 THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000873 THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000874 HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000875 WILL YOU GIVE ME THOSE STAMPS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000876 I LEFT HER HANGING AROUND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000877 HE HAD BEEN TO THE VILLAGE ONLY ONCE THE YEAR BEFORE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000878 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000879 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000880 WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000881 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000882 LOOK AT THOSE SHOULDERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000883 THE SUN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000884 SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000885 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000886 I WILL BE BACK SOON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000887 WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000888 MRS SARAH DOESN'T EITHER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000889 WELLI DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000890 HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000891 I THOUGHT YOU WERE CHASING ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000892 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000893 NOTE THAT IT DOES HAVE BUILTIN SUPPORT FOR WEB BROWSING ALTHOUGH I FIND IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000894 THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000895 THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT SORTS OF FUEL AT THIS GAS STATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000896 I GOTTA FIGURE SOME WAY OUT OF THIS THING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000897 IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000898 THIS BEHAVIOR OF NEURAL NETWORKS IS SOMETIMES CALLED DREAMING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000899 DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000900 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000901 THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000902 THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000903 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000904 ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000905 I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE HIM SINCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000906 I'M AFRAID I MIGHT HAVE SOILED THE COUCH A LITTLE WITH MY SHOES EDDIE MURPHY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000907 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000908 THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SO DID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000909 WHO TOLD YOU THAT ASKED THE BOY STARTLED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000910 HE DECIDED TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000911 MY FATHER OFFERED HER A JOB
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000912 IT WAS PAPA THAT SENDS YOU FLOWERS EVERY DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000913 ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000914 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000915 I JUMPED IN TO SAVE RACHEL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000916 THAT'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000917 IS THE HEAD BETTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000918 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000919 THAT WOMAN IS GONNA BE ON THAT ROOF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000920 I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000921 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000922 HE RECITED AN OUR FATHER SILENTLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000923 THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000924 AND HERE'S A KISS FOR YOU
