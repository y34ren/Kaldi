sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000875 WILL YOU GIVE ME THOSE STAMPS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000876 I LEFT HER HANGING AROUND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000877 HE HAD BEEN TO THE VILLAGE ONLY ONCE THE YEAR BEFORE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000878 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000879 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000880 WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000881 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000882 LOOK AT THOSE SHOULDERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000883 THE SUN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000884 SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000885 HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000886 I WILL BE BACK SOON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000887 WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000888 MRS SARAH DOESN'T EITHER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000889 WELLI DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000890 HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000891 I THOUGHT YOU WERE CHASING ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000892 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000893 NOTE THAT IT DOES HAVE BUILTIN SUPPORT FOR WEB BROWSING ALTHOUGH I FIND IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000894 THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000895 THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT SORTS OF FUEL AT THIS GAS STATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000896 I GOTTA FIGURE SOME WAY OUT OF THIS THING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000897 IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000898 THIS BEHAVIOR OF NEURAL NETWORKS IS SOMETIMES CALLED DREAMING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000899 DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000900 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000901 THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000902 THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000903 THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000904 ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000905 I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE HIM SINCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000906 I'M AFRAID I MIGHT HAVE SOILED THE COUCH A LITTLE WITH MY SHOES EDDIE MURPHY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000907 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000908 THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SO DID THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000909 WHO TOLD YOU THAT ASKED THE BOY STARTLED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000910 HE DECIDED TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000911 MY FATHER OFFERED HER A JOB
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000912 IT WAS PAPA THAT SENDS YOU FLOWERS EVERY DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000913 ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000914 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000915 I JUMPED IN TO SAVE RACHEL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000916 THAT'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000917 IS THE HEAD BETTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000918 HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000919 THAT WOMAN IS GONNA BE ON THAT ROOF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000920 I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000921 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000922 HE RECITED AN OUR FATHER SILENTLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000923 THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000924 AND HERE'S A KISS FOR YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000925 WHO WROTE THAT SPEECH FOR YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000926 SAVE THAT FOR THE TRIBUNE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000927 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000928 SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000929 I DON'T LIKE SEALS ANYHOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000930 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000931 AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000932 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO LEARN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000933 YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000934 THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000935 THE SHIP APPEARED TO BE CONSTRUCTED WITH SOME FORM OF CHROMIUM EXOSKELETON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000936 NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECKPOINTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000937 IT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT GUARANTEES EVERYONE'S FREEDOM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000938 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000939 A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000940 MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000941 YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAY DIE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000942 THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000943 THEN A MAN APPROACHED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000944 BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000945 AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000946 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY ALWAYS STAY CLOSE TO ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000947 I'M AN ALCHEMIST SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M AN ALCHEMIST HE SAID AS HE PREPARED THE MEAL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000948 JENNIFER'S EXPRESSION CHANGED PULL MY FINGER SHE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000949 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
