cv-valid-train-sample-000752 THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED

cv-valid-train-sample-000755 BECAUSE FOR HIM YOU ARE A GREEN FIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME
cv-valid-train-sample-000756 DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000757 IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
cv-valid-train-sample-000758 BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
cv-valid-train-sample-000759 FEBRUARY TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES
cv-valid-train-sample-000760 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
cv-valid-train-sample-000761 IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000762 THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
cv-valid-train-sample-000763 UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
cv-valid-train-sample-000764 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
cv-valid-train-sample-000765 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ROMANTIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000766 THE FOOTBALL JOCKS LAUGHED VICIOUSLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000767 YOU'RE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD

cv-valid-train-sample-000769 BUT USE THEM TO BUY YOUR FLOCK
cv-valid-train-sample-000770 THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
cv-valid-train-sample-000771 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000772 BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM
cv-valid-train-sample-000773 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000774 THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
cv-valid-train-sample-000775 HAVE YOU GOT A MIRROR
cv-valid-train-sample-000776 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000777 THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000778 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
cv-valid-train-sample-000779 THE PILOTS BRACED THEMSELVES FOR IMPACT
cv-valid-train-sample-000780 IT WAS A A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
cv-valid-train-sample-000781 LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
cv-valid-train-sample-000782 HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
cv-valid-train-sample-000783 AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
cv-valid-train-sample-000784 AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
cv-valid-train-sample-000785 HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
cv-valid-train-sample-000786 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
cv-valid-train-sample-000787 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
cv-valid-train-sample-000788 I CAN EXPLAIN IF YOU'LL JUST LISTEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000789 THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
cv-valid-train-sample-000790 IT'S NOT A LIE
cv-valid-train-sample-000791 IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
cv-valid-train-sample-000792 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
cv-valid-train-sample-000793 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
cv-valid-train-sample-000794 NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000795 HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000796 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000797 JUST AS A RULE OF THUMB
cv-valid-train-sample-000798 I REALLY DID IT QUITE BRILLIANTLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000799 AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
cv-valid-train-sample-000800 GET ME WALTER BURNS
cv-valid-train-sample-000801 HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF
cv-valid-train-sample-000802 PEOPLE CONTINUED TO COME AND GO FROM THE BAKER'S SHOP
cv-valid-train-sample-000803 THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
cv-valid-train-sample-000804 YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000805 WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
cv-valid-train-sample-000806 FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
cv-valid-train-sample-000807 I WISH YOU'D FORGET ABOUT US
cv-valid-train-sample-000808 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
cv-valid-train-sample-000809 THE BOOK THAT MOST INTERESTED THE BOY TOLD THE STORIES OF THE FAMOUS ALCHEMISTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000810 ARE YOU CRAZY THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON

cv-valid-train-sample-000812 MY ALLERGY HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE TODAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000813 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING AND LOAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000814 BEEN SEEING ME IN YOUR DREAMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000815 THE STRANGER WITHDREW THE SWORD FROM THE BOY'S FOREHEAD AND THE BOY FELT IMMENSELY RELIEVED
cv-valid-train-sample-000816 SHE NEVER GREW UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000817 THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
cv-valid-train-sample-000818 FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
cv-valid-train-sample-000819 MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
cv-valid-train-sample-000820 SAME WAY YOU DID
cv-valid-train-sample-000821 THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000822 WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000823 AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
