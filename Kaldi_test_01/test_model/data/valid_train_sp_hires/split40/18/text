sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000275 MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000276 ARABS OFTEN APPEARED IN THE CITY SHOPPING AND CHANTING THEIR STRANGE PRAYERS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000277 THERE IS A REPTILE IN MY WESTERN SHOES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000278 HOW ARE YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000279 I WANT TO STAY AT THE OASIS THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000280 AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000281 WHAT'S IN THAT DESK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000282 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000283 I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000284 THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000285 SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000286 DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AT AN ABANDONED CHURCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000287 EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000288 BECAUSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WOULD FIND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000289 IN HIS HEART HE WANTED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO SLEEP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000290 THE BOY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000291 THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000292 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000293 WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000294 THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000295 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000296 THE BOY SWORE THAT EVERY TIME HE HEARD THE ALARM HE WOULD HEED ITS MESSAGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000297 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000298 I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000299 WE CAN ONLY PERCEIVE A PART OF THE BROAD LIGHT SPECTRUM THE SUN EMITS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000300 THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000301 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000302 FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000303 I DON'T KNOW YOU FROM ADAM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000304 THEY WERE RACING DOWN THE STREETS WITH NO REGARD FOR ANYONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000305 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000306 IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000307 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000308 THERESA COULDN'T FEEL ANY MORE DUMB RIGHT NOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000309 HE'S ALLERGIC TO HIM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000310 I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET SOME STYLISH UNDERWEAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000311 THIRTY EVERY THURSDAY SIXTY AT SIXTY WHO KNOWS WHAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000312 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000313 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000314 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000315 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000316 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000317 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000318 THERE'S A LOT MORE YOU CAN DO WITH A TIGHTER INTEGRATION WITH THE EYE TRACKING API
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000319 HE KNEW WHAT I WAS THINKING THE BOY SAID TO HIMSELF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000320 WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO WRITE ABOUT HILLARY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000321 HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000322 JOHNATHAN ASSESSED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000323 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000324 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000325 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000326 HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THE STRANGE LAND HE WAS IN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000327 FROM THAT DAY ON IT WAS THE DESERT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000328 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000329 AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE MAN LIVED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000330 IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000331 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000332 IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELED BY FIREWOOD WITH A TRANSPARENT FLASK HEATING ON TOP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000333 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000334 SO IMMERSE YOURSELF IN IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000335 WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000336 BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000337 HIS NAME IS WELCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000338 THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000339 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000340 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000341 THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000342 THE MAN LOOKED AT THE ANGEL IN SURPRISE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000343 BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000344 THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MORE TEA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000345 THAT WAS HIS WORK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000346 WHAT YOUR HUSBAND WAS MIXED UP IN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000347 THE BOY RECALLED THE BRILLIANCE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000348 IF I'M ON THE MARCH I JUST CONCENTRATE ON MARCHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000349 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
