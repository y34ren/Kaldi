sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000500 HE'S THE MAN THE ADS ARE WRITTEN FOR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000501 AND ABOVE ALL DON'T FORGET TO FOLLOW YOUR DESTINY THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000502 HER ACHIEVEMENTS WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000503 I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000504 WE WANT SOME ACTION IN THESE PICTURES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000505 SYMBOLS OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000506 THIS GUY STOLE MY WATCH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000507 IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WINE HE HAD EVER TASTED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000508 IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000509 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000510 THE SPACE WAS SPARTAN ALMOST BARE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000511 DO YOU MIND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE CROWDED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000512 IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000513 ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000514 IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000515 HE'S THE ONLY HUSBAND I'VE GOT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000516 THIS IS FOR YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000517 THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000518 HE NEVER ASKED ME TO SIT DOWN IN HIS LIFE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000519 MY NAME'S PETE DAVIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000520 PRETTY NICE NECK YOU'VE GOT THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000521 AN ARMY IS COMING THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000522 YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000523 YOU MEAN HERE IN THE CITY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000524 REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOUR HEART IS THERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000525 REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOUR HEART IS THERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000526 I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000527 THE BOY APPROACHED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000528 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000529 I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000530 AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000531 HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000532 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000533 THE BOY FELT ILL AND TERRIBLY ALONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000534 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000535 WILL YOU EXCUSE US A MINUTE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000536 I'M LOVING IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000537 AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000538 YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000539 YOUR HEART IS ALIVE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000540 PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS VILLAGE SON SAID HIS FATHER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000541 AND THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY WELL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000542 VICTORIA DOES THINGS IN A MUCH BIGGER WAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000543 I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000544 I'D HATE TO HAVE THAT MANY PINS STUCK IN ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000545 BUT WHAT'S ALL THIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000546 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000547 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000548 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000549 HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000550 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000551 AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000552 WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000553 HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000554 DOESNT IT DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF HASHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000555 AND THAT HE A BOY COULD PERFORM MIRACLES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000556 IT WON'T HURT YOU AND WE CAN MAKE THE CITY EDITION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000557 THE NAVY'S GOING TO FLY FATHER HOME THIS AFTERNOON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000558 HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000559 I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000560 WE ATE SPICY RICE WITH CHICKEN LEGS AND WHITE MUSHROOMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000561 THE HEAT LASTED UNTIL NIGHTFALL AND ALL THAT TIME HE HAD TO CARRY HIS JACKET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000562 AND I'LL SIGN A PAPER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000563 THAT'S AN INHERENT DISADVANTAGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000564 I'D BETTER HUSTLE HIM UP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000565 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000566 EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000567 I'M AFRAID SHE'D FEEL ASHAMED TO THINK SHE HADN'T TRUSTED YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000568 BUT I'M GOING TO EGYPT THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000569 WHAT WERE YOU WHEN YOU CAME HERE FIVE YEARS AGO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000570 I GOT IT BACK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000571 I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000572 SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000573 FASTFOOD IS CONVENIENT BUT OFTEN UNHEALTHY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000574 HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE MORNING'S MEETING
