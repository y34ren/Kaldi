sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000200 THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000201 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000202 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000203 I KNOW ITS DIMENSIONS AND HOW IT BEHAVES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000204 OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000205 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000206 TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000207 GET DOWN QUICK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000208 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000209 HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HOLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000210 YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000211 IT WAS HARASSMENT PURE AND SIMPLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000212 THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS CAPE AND THE BOY WAS STRUCK BY WHAT HE SAW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000213 HOW WAS THAT FOR A TIGHT SQUEEZE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000214 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000215 WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000216 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000217 GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SEASON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000218 THE DISPLAY WAS UNDERWHELMING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000219 NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FELLOWS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000220 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000221 THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000222 I'M GONNA BUILD AIR FIELDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000223 HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000224 A POX UPON ME FOR A CLUMSY THING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000225 STOVE'S HOTTER THAN I THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000226 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000227 THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000228 IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000229 YOU THINK IT'S EASY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000230 THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000231 I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000232 THE WIRELESS JOYPAD WAS EXPERIENCING CONNECTION ISSUES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000233 AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000234 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000235 IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000236 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000237 THAT'S WHY ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE NICE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000238 THIS IS A TRICK TO GET YOUR SYMPATHY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000239 IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000240 THE SHOP WAS BUSY AND THE MAN ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000241 SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000242 TONIGHT THEY WOULD FIND OUT THE TRUTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000243 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000244 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000245 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000246 HE HAD ASSUMED HE WOULD SOON RETURN TO HIS SHEEP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000247 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000248 NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000249 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000250 HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000251 I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000252 THIS IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION SHELDON SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000253 I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000254 IT ALL HAPPENED RATHER SUDDENLY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000255 SURE SEE YOU THERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000256 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000257 A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000258 HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000259 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000260 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000261 PATRICK HAS TERMINAL CANCER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000262 THIS IS JON DAVIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000263 THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000264 ONE AFTERNOON ONE OF HIS SERVANTS FELL ILL AND IT APPEARED THAT HE WOULD DIE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000265 ACCORDING TO THE PREDOMINANT NOTION IN THE VATICAN CONDOMS SHOULDN'T BE USED IN SPITE OF HIV
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000266 BUT YOU ARE FORCING ME TO LOOK AT WEALTH AND AT HORIZONS I HAVE NEVER KNOWN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000267 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000268 HE PAID FOR THE WOOL AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000269 THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000270 AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000271 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000272 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000273 I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000274 I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
