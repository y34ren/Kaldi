sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000925 WHO WROTE THAT SPEECH FOR YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000926 SAVE THAT FOR THE TRIBUNE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000927 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000928 SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000929 I DON'T LIKE SEALS ANYHOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000930 THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000931 AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000932 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO LEARN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000933 YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000934 THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000935 THE SHIP APPEARED TO BE CONSTRUCTED WITH SOME FORM OF CHROMIUM EXOSKELETON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000936 NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECKPOINTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000937 IT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT GUARANTEES EVERYONE'S FREEDOM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000938 THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000939 A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000940 MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000941 YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAY DIE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000942 THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000943 THEN A MAN APPROACHED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000944 BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000945 AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000946 MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY ALWAYS STAY CLOSE TO ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000947 I'M AN ALCHEMIST SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M AN ALCHEMIST HE SAID AS HE PREPARED THE MEAL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000948 JENNIFER'S EXPRESSION CHANGED PULL MY FINGER SHE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000949 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000950 THE OLD MAN LEAFED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000951 I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000952 AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000953 THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000954 RELAXED AND UNHURRIED HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD WALK THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF TANGIER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000955 THE MEETING WAS OVER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000956 ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000957 THAT WASN'T AT ALL NECESSARY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000958 I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000959 WHEN HE EMERGED IT WAS WITH A YOUNG ARAB DRESSED IN WHITE AND GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000960 WERE THEY QUICK OR WERE THEY ENRAGED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000961 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000962 AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000963 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE IN HIS HEART THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO DO SO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000964 THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000965 BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TWICE WILL SURELY HAPPEN A THIRD TIME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000966 AND THIS IS WHAT YOUR SON SAID THE ANGEL TOLD THE MAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000967 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000968 WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000969 IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000970 HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000971 YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000972 IF IT WOULD SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000973 HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000974 THEY WERE ALL FURIOUS WHEN THE ESCAPADE FAILED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000975 IT ALWAYS HELPS TO BE LEARNING SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000976 WHERE ARE YOU BOUND ASKED THE YOUNG ARAB
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000977 AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000978 I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000979 I'M NOT AFRAID OF FAILING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000980 SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000981 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000982 ANY DOPE YET ON HOW HE GOT OUT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000983 THEY'RE NOT FOR SALE HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000984 THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000985 MIND IF I SIT DOWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000986 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000987 HE HAD STUDIED LATIN SPANISH AND THEOLOGY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000988 MR BEAN IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF A BRITISH COMEDY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000989 THE IDEAS SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN A MORE CONCISE AND DIRECT MANNER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000990 ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000991 I'M GOING TO CHECK UP ON THAT RIGHT AWAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000992 BUTMAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000993 I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000994 EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000995 IT WAS ENGINEERING AT ITS FINEST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000996 ALL THINGS ARE ONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000997 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000998 I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000999 HOW ABOUT ONCE MORE AROUND THE PARK
