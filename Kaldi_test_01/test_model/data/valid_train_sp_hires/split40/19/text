sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000350 THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000351 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000352 IT'S THE ONLY ONE THEY HAD LEFT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000353 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000354 HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000355 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000356 THERE WAS NO OTHER BAGGAGE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000357 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000358 DID YOU SAY A KING HE ASKED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000359 WHAT HE SAID REMINDED THE BOY OF THE OLD KING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000360 BUT WE COULD SELL TEA IN CRYSTAL GLASSES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000361 HE WAS THINKING ABOUT OMENS AND SOMEONE HAD APPEARED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000362 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000363 IN THE DISCOTHEQUE THE DJ PLAYED PROGRESSIVE HOUSE MUSIC AND TRANCE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000364 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000365 I'VE WATCHED YOU GROW UP FROM A LITTLE BOY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000366 IT'S THE ONLY NAME I'VE GOT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000367 THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000368 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000369 I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000370 IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000371 THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000372 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000373 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000374 BUT AS TIME PASSED TANGIER HAD CHANGED
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000375 MY KEYCHAIN IS HEAVY AND AWKWARD TO CARRY IN MY POCKET
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000376 I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000377 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000378 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000379 I KNOW THAT GIRL
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000380 HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000381 BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000382 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000383 LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000384 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000385 HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000386 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000387 HOW COULD HE BE A FAKE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000388 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000389 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000390 ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000391 I FEEL LIKE A BOOTLEGGER
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000392 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000393 THEN GET OUT OF HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000394 THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000395 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000396 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000397 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000398 YOU ALL KNOW ME
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000399 WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PLODDING THROUGH SOME USER INTERVIEWS AT THE MOMENT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000400 I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THAT TUB
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000401 A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000402 THIS DESERT WAS ONCE A SEA HE SAID
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000403 BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000404 ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000405 HE HAD NO IDEA HOW HE WAS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000406 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000407 AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000408 THAT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000409 I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000410 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000411 THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000412 IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000413 SHE JOINED UP TOO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000414 STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000415 WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000416 THERE'S LIFE HERE THE BOY SAID TO THE ALCHEMIST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000417 YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000418 I'M GOING TO THEM
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000419 MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000420 IT BELONGS TO ME NOW
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000421 HAS HE BEEN HERE
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000422 BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000423 YOU SAID YOU WANTED FIREWORKS
sp0.9-cv-valid-train-sample-000424 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
