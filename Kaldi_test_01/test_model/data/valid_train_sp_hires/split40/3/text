cv-valid-train-sample-000150 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000151 I NEVER STOLE A WATCH IN MY LIFE
cv-valid-train-sample-000152 GOOD LUCK TO YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000153 MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000154 I WAS JUST ASKING
cv-valid-train-sample-000155 LET HIM HAVE EVERYTHING HE WANTS
cv-valid-train-sample-000156 THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000157 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
cv-valid-train-sample-000158 EGYPT IS A COUNTRY THAT IS OFTEN MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000159 HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
cv-valid-train-sample-000160 THE BOY KNEW AND WAS NOW WORKING TOWARD IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000161 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000162 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
cv-valid-train-sample-000163 THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
cv-valid-train-sample-000164 IT IS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000165 THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
cv-valid-train-sample-000166 WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
cv-valid-train-sample-000167 THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
cv-valid-train-sample-000168 THE ALARM CLOCK WAS SET FOR TWENTY PAST THREE
cv-valid-train-sample-000169 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000170 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
cv-valid-train-sample-000171 THE BOY WENT TO THE WELL EVERY DAY TO MEET WITH FATIMA
cv-valid-train-sample-000172 IT'S THE NAME OF THE PROPHET'S DAUGHTER FATIMA SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000173 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000174 THE BOY REMEMBERED HIS DREAM AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR TO HIM
cv-valid-train-sample-000175 GET SOME WATER QUICKLY
cv-valid-train-sample-000176 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
cv-valid-train-sample-000177 THERE WAS A LOUD SHRIEK FROM A WOMAN STANDING BEHIND US
cv-valid-train-sample-000178 THEN LEAVE WITH THE CARAVAN
cv-valid-train-sample-000179 HE IS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND JUST TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000180 YOU'RE STILL A GOOD REPORTER
cv-valid-train-sample-000181 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
cv-valid-train-sample-000182 THERE ISN'T ANY MORE WINE
cv-valid-train-sample-000183 DOES THIS BELONG TO YOU
cv-valid-train-sample-000184 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
cv-valid-train-sample-000185 THEY WANTED TO SAVE THE OASIS
cv-valid-train-sample-000186 TWO HORSEMEN WAITING AHEAD OF THEM
cv-valid-train-sample-000187 I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000188 I DON'T MUCH LIKE CHANGE HE SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000189 THE DUNES ARE CHANGED BY THE WIND BUT THE DESERT NEVER CHANGES
cv-valid-train-sample-000190 SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS
cv-valid-train-sample-000191 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000192 HE'S IN MY ROOM
cv-valid-train-sample-000193 IS SHE AS GOOD AS YOU SAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000194 THEY FILLED THREE SACKS
cv-valid-train-sample-000195 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
cv-valid-train-sample-000196 THIS IS THE MORNING POST YOU'RE TALKING TO
cv-valid-train-sample-000197 YOU WILL SPEND THAT HOUR GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH MARSHALL BAILEY
cv-valid-train-sample-000198 THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000199 IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
cv-valid-train-sample-000200 THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE
cv-valid-train-sample-000201 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
cv-valid-train-sample-000202 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000203 I KNOW ITS DIMENSIONS AND HOW IT BEHAVES
cv-valid-train-sample-000204 OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT
cv-valid-train-sample-000205 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
cv-valid-train-sample-000206 TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
cv-valid-train-sample-000207 GET DOWN QUICK
cv-valid-train-sample-000208 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
cv-valid-train-sample-000209 HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HOLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000210 YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
cv-valid-train-sample-000211 IT WAS HARASSMENT PURE AND SIMPLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000212 THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS CAPE AND THE BOY WAS STRUCK BY WHAT HE SAW
cv-valid-train-sample-000213 HOW WAS THAT FOR A TIGHT SQUEEZE
cv-valid-train-sample-000214 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
cv-valid-train-sample-000215 WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
cv-valid-train-sample-000216 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
cv-valid-train-sample-000217 GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SEASON
cv-valid-train-sample-000218 THE DISPLAY WAS UNDERWHELMING
cv-valid-train-sample-000219 NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FELLOWS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
cv-valid-train-sample-000220 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
cv-valid-train-sample-000221 THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
cv-valid-train-sample-000222 I'M GONNA BUILD AIR FIELDS
cv-valid-train-sample-000223 HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
cv-valid-train-sample-000224 A POX UPON ME FOR A CLUMSY THING
