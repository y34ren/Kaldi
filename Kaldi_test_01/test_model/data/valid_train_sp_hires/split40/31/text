sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000250 HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000251 I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000252 THIS IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION SHELDON SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000253 I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000254 IT ALL HAPPENED RATHER SUDDENLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000255 SURE SEE YOU THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000256 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000257 A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000258 HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000259 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000260 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000261 PATRICK HAS TERMINAL CANCER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000262 THIS IS JON DAVIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000263 THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000264 ONE AFTERNOON ONE OF HIS SERVANTS FELL ILL AND IT APPEARED THAT HE WOULD DIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000265 ACCORDING TO THE PREDOMINANT NOTION IN THE VATICAN CONDOMS SHOULDN'T BE USED IN SPITE OF HIV
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000266 BUT YOU ARE FORCING ME TO LOOK AT WEALTH AND AT HORIZONS I HAVE NEVER KNOWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000267 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000268 HE PAID FOR THE WOOL AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000269 THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000270 AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000271 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000272 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000273 I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000274 I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000275 MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000276 ARABS OFTEN APPEARED IN THE CITY SHOPPING AND CHANTING THEIR STRANGE PRAYERS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000277 THERE IS A REPTILE IN MY WESTERN SHOES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000278 HOW ARE YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000279 I WANT TO STAY AT THE OASIS THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000280 AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000281 WHAT'S IN THAT DESK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000282 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000283 I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000284 THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000285 SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000286 DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AT AN ABANDONED CHURCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000287 EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000288 BECAUSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WOULD FIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000289 IN HIS HEART HE WANTED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO SLEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000290 THE BOY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000291 THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000292 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000293 WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000294 THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000295 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000296 THE BOY SWORE THAT EVERY TIME HE HEARD THE ALARM HE WOULD HEED ITS MESSAGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000297 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000298 I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000299 WE CAN ONLY PERCEIVE A PART OF THE BROAD LIGHT SPECTRUM THE SUN EMITS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000300 THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000301 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000302 FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000303 I DON'T KNOW YOU FROM ADAM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000304 THEY WERE RACING DOWN THE STREETS WITH NO REGARD FOR ANYONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000305 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000306 IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000307 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000308 THERESA COULDN'T FEEL ANY MORE DUMB RIGHT NOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000309 HE'S ALLERGIC TO HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000310 I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET SOME STYLISH UNDERWEAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000311 THIRTY EVERY THURSDAY SIXTY AT SIXTY WHO KNOWS WHAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000312 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000313 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000314 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000315 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000316 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000317 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000318 THERE'S A LOT MORE YOU CAN DO WITH A TIGHTER INTEGRATION WITH THE EYE TRACKING API
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000319 HE KNEW WHAT I WAS THINKING THE BOY SAID TO HIMSELF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000320 WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO WRITE ABOUT HILLARY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000321 HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000322 JOHNATHAN ASSESSED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000323 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000324 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
