sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000100 HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000101 THE FUMES FROM THE TRAFFIC WAS UNBEARABLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000102 ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000103 THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000104 BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000105 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY APPARENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000106 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000107 THE ENGLISHMAN HAD SEVERAL SUITCASES FILLED WITH BOOKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000108 HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000109 IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000110 WISH I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000111 HE STILL CALLS HIS MOTHER MUMMY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000112 IT'S COMMON TO RUN INTO PROBLEMS SO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000113 JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000114 THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000115 HARRY'LL TEAR HIS DINNER SUIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000116 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000117 YOU'VE GOT HIS GUN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000118 HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000119 IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT IT MATTERS A LOT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000120 WE MUST BE GOOD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000121 WATCH OVER HER TONIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000122 DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000123 THERE'S A MOON OUT TONIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000124 THE BOY REPEATED HIS QUESTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000125 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000126 YOU'RE A WEEK LATE FOR SCHOOL ALREADY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000127 YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000128 YOU HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR DREAMS ABOUT THE OLD KING AND YOUR TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000129 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000130 REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000131 THE LEVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000132 WITH THE GIRL WITH THE RAVEN HAIR HIS DAYS WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000133 HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000134 WEAR THE BLUE ONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000135 LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOURLEAF CLOVERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000136 I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000137 I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000138 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000139 THE TWO WALKED OUT AMONG THE PALMS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000140 HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000141 THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000142 MEN HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS OF THE WISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000143 HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000144 I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000145 GET THE BULLETIN BOARD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000146 THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000147 YOU TOLD ME THAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000148 NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000149 DO YOU WANT TO WAKE THAT BABY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000150 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000151 I NEVER STOLE A WATCH IN MY LIFE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000152 GOOD LUCK TO YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000153 MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000154 I WAS JUST ASKING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000155 LET HIM HAVE EVERYTHING HE WANTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000156 THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000157 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000158 EGYPT IS A COUNTRY THAT IS OFTEN MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000159 HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000160 THE BOY KNEW AND WAS NOW WORKING TOWARD IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000161 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000162 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000163 THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000164 IT IS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000165 THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000166 WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000167 THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000168 THE ALARM CLOCK WAS SET FOR TWENTY PAST THREE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000169 MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000170 COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000171 THE BOY WENT TO THE WELL EVERY DAY TO MEET WITH FATIMA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000172 IT'S THE NAME OF THE PROPHET'S DAUGHTER FATIMA SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000173 I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000174 THE BOY REMEMBERED HIS DREAM AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR TO HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000175 GET SOME WATER QUICKLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000176 THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000177 THERE WAS A LOUD SHRIEK FROM A WOMAN STANDING BEHIND US
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000178 THEN LEAVE WITH THE CARAVAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000179 HE IS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND JUST TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000180 YOU'RE STILL A GOOD REPORTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000181 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000182 THERE ISN'T ANY MORE WINE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000183 DOES THIS BELONG TO YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000184 THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000185 THEY WANTED TO SAVE THE OASIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000186 TWO HORSEMEN WAITING AHEAD OF THEM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000187 I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000188 I DON'T MUCH LIKE CHANGE HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000189 THE DUNES ARE CHANGED BY THE WIND BUT THE DESERT NEVER CHANGES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000190 SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000191 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000192 HE'S IN MY ROOM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000193 IS SHE AS GOOD AS YOU SAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000194 THEY FILLED THREE SACKS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000195 OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000196 THIS IS THE MORNING POST YOU'RE TALKING TO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000197 YOU WILL SPEND THAT HOUR GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH MARSHALL BAILEY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000198 THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000199 IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000200 THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000201 MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000202 I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000203 I KNOW ITS DIMENSIONS AND HOW IT BEHAVES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000204 OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000205 I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000206 TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000207 GET DOWN QUICK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000208 TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000209 HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HOLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000210 YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000211 IT WAS HARASSMENT PURE AND SIMPLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000212 THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS CAPE AND THE BOY WAS STRUCK BY WHAT HE SAW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000213 HOW WAS THAT FOR A TIGHT SQUEEZE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000214 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000215 WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000216 THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000217 GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SEASON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000218 THE DISPLAY WAS UNDERWHELMING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000219 NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FELLOWS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000220 NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000221 THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000222 I'M GONNA BUILD AIR FIELDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000223 HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000224 A POX UPON ME FOR A CLUMSY THING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000225 STOVE'S HOTTER THAN I THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000226 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000227 THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000228 IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000229 YOU THINK IT'S EASY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000230 THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000231 I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000232 THE WIRELESS JOYPAD WAS EXPERIENCING CONNECTION ISSUES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000233 AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000234 DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000235 IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000236 LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000237 THAT'S WHY ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE NICE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000238 THIS IS A TRICK TO GET YOUR SYMPATHY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000239 IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000240 THE SHOP WAS BUSY AND THE MAN ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000241 SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000242 TONIGHT THEY WOULD FIND OUT THE TRUTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000243 MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000244 THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000245 SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000246 HE HAD ASSUMED HE WOULD SOON RETURN TO HIS SHEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000247 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000248 NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000249 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000250 HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000251 I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000252 THIS IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION SHELDON SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000253 I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000254 IT ALL HAPPENED RATHER SUDDENLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000255 SURE SEE YOU THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000256 THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000257 A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000258 HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000259 ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000260 MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000261 PATRICK HAS TERMINAL CANCER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000262 THIS IS JON DAVIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000263 THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000264 ONE AFTERNOON ONE OF HIS SERVANTS FELL ILL AND IT APPEARED THAT HE WOULD DIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000265 ACCORDING TO THE PREDOMINANT NOTION IN THE VATICAN CONDOMS SHOULDN'T BE USED IN SPITE OF HIV
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000266 BUT YOU ARE FORCING ME TO LOOK AT WEALTH AND AT HORIZONS I HAVE NEVER KNOWN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000267 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000268 HE PAID FOR THE WOOL AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000269 THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000270 AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000271 HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000272 THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000273 I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000274 I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000275 MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000276 ARABS OFTEN APPEARED IN THE CITY SHOPPING AND CHANTING THEIR STRANGE PRAYERS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000277 THERE IS A REPTILE IN MY WESTERN SHOES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000278 HOW ARE YOU
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000279 I WANT TO STAY AT THE OASIS THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000280 AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000281 WHAT'S IN THAT DESK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000282 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000283 I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000284 THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000285 SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000286 DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AT AN ABANDONED CHURCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000287 EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000288 BECAUSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WOULD FIND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000289 IN HIS HEART HE WANTED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO SLEEP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000290 THE BOY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000291 THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000292 AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000293 WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000294 THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000295 I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000296 THE BOY SWORE THAT EVERY TIME HE HEARD THE ALARM HE WOULD HEED ITS MESSAGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000297 I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000298 I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000299 WE CAN ONLY PERCEIVE A PART OF THE BROAD LIGHT SPECTRUM THE SUN EMITS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000300 THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000301 THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000302 FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000303 I DON'T KNOW YOU FROM ADAM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000304 THEY WERE RACING DOWN THE STREETS WITH NO REGARD FOR ANYONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000305 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000306 IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000307 THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000308 THERESA COULDN'T FEEL ANY MORE DUMB RIGHT NOW
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000309 HE'S ALLERGIC TO HIM
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000310 I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET SOME STYLISH UNDERWEAR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000311 THIRTY EVERY THURSDAY SIXTY AT SIXTY WHO KNOWS WHAT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000312 I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000313 A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000314 SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000315 I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000316 YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000317 DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000318 THERE'S A LOT MORE YOU CAN DO WITH A TIGHTER INTEGRATION WITH THE EYE TRACKING API
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000319 HE KNEW WHAT I WAS THINKING THE BOY SAID TO HIMSELF
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000320 WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO WRITE ABOUT HILLARY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000321 HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000322 JOHNATHAN ASSESSED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000323 THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000324 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000325 HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000326 HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THE STRANGE LAND HE WAS IN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000327 FROM THAT DAY ON IT WAS THE DESERT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000328 IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000329 AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE MAN LIVED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000330 IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000331 WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000332 IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELED BY FIREWOOD WITH A TRANSPARENT FLASK HEATING ON TOP
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000333 HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000334 SO IMMERSE YOURSELF IN IT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000335 WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000336 BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000337 HIS NAME IS WELCH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000338 THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000339 BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000340 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000341 THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000342 THE MAN LOOKED AT THE ANGEL IN SURPRISE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000343 BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000344 THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MORE TEA
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000345 THAT WAS HIS WORK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000346 WHAT YOUR HUSBAND WAS MIXED UP IN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000347 THE BOY RECALLED THE BRILLIANCE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000348 IF I'M ON THE MARCH I JUST CONCENTRATE ON MARCHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000349 WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000350 THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000351 THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000352 IT'S THE ONLY ONE THEY HAD LEFT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000353 AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000354 HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000355 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000356 THERE WAS NO OTHER BAGGAGE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000357 BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000358 DID YOU SAY A KING HE ASKED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000359 WHAT HE SAID REMINDED THE BOY OF THE OLD KING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000360 BUT WE COULD SELL TEA IN CRYSTAL GLASSES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000361 HE WAS THINKING ABOUT OMENS AND SOMEONE HAD APPEARED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000362 DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000363 IN THE DISCOTHEQUE THE DJ PLAYED PROGRESSIVE HOUSE MUSIC AND TRANCE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000364 I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000365 I'VE WATCHED YOU GROW UP FROM A LITTLE BOY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000366 IT'S THE ONLY NAME I'VE GOT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000367 THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000368 THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000369 I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000370 IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000371 THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000372 THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000373 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000374 BUT AS TIME PASSED TANGIER HAD CHANGED
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000375 MY KEYCHAIN IS HEAVY AND AWKWARD TO CARRY IN MY POCKET
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000376 I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000377 THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000378 THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000379 I KNOW THAT GIRL
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000380 HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000381 BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000382 SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000383 LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000384 TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000385 HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000386 THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000387 HOW COULD HE BE A FAKE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000388 THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000389 MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000390 ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000391 I FEEL LIKE A BOOTLEGGER
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000392 IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000393 THEN GET OUT OF HERE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000394 THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000395 OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000396 THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000397 IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000398 YOU ALL KNOW ME
sp1.1-cv-valid-train-sample-000399 WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PLODDING THROUGH SOME USER INTERVIEWS AT THE MOMENT
