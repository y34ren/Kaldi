A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
A LOT OF MONEY
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK
A MAN DOESN'T GET IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS EVERY DAY
A POX UPON ME FOR A CLUMSY THING
A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
ACCORDING TO THE PREDOMINANT NOTION IN THE VATICAN CONDOMS SHOULDN'T BE USED IN SPITE OF HIV
AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
ALL THE VILLAGERS CHEERED
ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
ALL THINGS ARE ONE
ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE BOY THOUGHT
ALL THIS HAPPENED BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNSET THE BOY THOUGHT
ALWAYS HEED THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID
AM I GOING TO FIND MY TREASURE HE ASKED
AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
AN ARMY IS COMING THE BOY SAID
AND A LABOR LEADER LIKE MELVILLE
AND ABOVE ALL DON'T FORGET TO FOLLOW YOUR DESTINY THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION
AND ALSO BY UNHAPPINESS ENVY AND JEALOUSY
AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
AND HE KNEW WHAT WAS THE FAIR PRICE FOR EVERY ONE OF HIS ANIMALS
AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
AND HERE'S A KISS FOR YOU
AND I'LL SIGN A PAPER
AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
AND STOP THREATENING THAT BOY
AND THAT HE A BOY COULD PERFORM MIRACLES
AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE MAN LIVED
AND THE LAST ONE
AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP
AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
AND THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY WELL
AND THIS IS WHAT YOUR SON SAID THE ANGEL TOLD THE MAN
AND TOMORROW HIS ENEMY WOULD ALSO BE A PART OF THAT SOUL
AND WE'LL BE AT LARISSA'S BAR UP THE STREET
AND WHAT A WAY TO QUIT
AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
ANOTHER WHO WAS SEARCHING THE BOY'S BAGS FOUND THE PIECE OF GOLD
ANY DOPE YET ON HOW HE GOT OUT
APPLE PIE IS AN ICONIC DISH
ARABS OFTEN APPEARED IN THE CITY SHOPPING AND CHANTING THEIR STRANGE PRAYERS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
ARE YOU CRAZY THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON
ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE EVERY LIE HE TELLS YOU
AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS
AS HE WAS LEAVING HE SAW IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM HIS OLD SHEPHERD'S POUCH
AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
AS THEY BEGAN TO DECORATE THE HALLWAY A SILHOUETTE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
ASK THE OWNER OF THAT STALL HOW MUCH THE SWORD COSTS HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND
AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
BECAUSE FOR HIM YOU ARE A GREEN FIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME
BECAUSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WOULD FIND
BECAUSE HE WAS TERRIFIED THE BOY DIDN'T ANSWER
BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM
BECAUSE NOW HE KNEW WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS
BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
BEEN SEEING ME IN YOUR DREAMS
BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
BUT AS TIME PASSED TANGIER HAD CHANGED
BUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TWICE WILL SURELY HAPPEN A THIRD TIME
BUT HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DESIRE THAT AN ARMY INVADE THE OASIS
BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
BUT HE FOUND IT MUCH MORE INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THE CARAVAN AND LISTEN TO THE WIND
BUT HE GRANTED THE TRAVELERS THREE DAYS
BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE AND DIDN'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY
BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
BUT I'M GOING TO EGYPT THE BOY SAID
BUT I'M LIABLE TO GET INTO A JAM
BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUMNI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
BUT MAYBE PEOPLE WHO FELT THAT WAY HAD NEVER LEARNED THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
BUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT HAD NO CHOICE
BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE IN HIS HEART THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW HIM TO DO SO
BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
BUT USE THEM TO BUY YOUR FLOCK
BUT WE COULD SELL TEA IN CRYSTAL GLASSES
BUT WHAT'S ALL THIS
BUT YOU ARE FORCING ME TO LOOK AT WEALTH AND AT HORIZONS I HAVE NEVER KNOWN
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOVE
BUTMAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
BY THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION I SAW THEM STAGGERING AND FALLING AND THEIR SUPPORTERS TURNING TO RUN
CAN I GET A WOOT WOOT
CAN'T YOU READ ME
CAROL SAVED HER BROTHER'S LIFE THAT DAY
COACH HAS HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU
COME IN AGAIN SOME TIME
COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE
DID YOU SAY A KING HE ASKED
DIDN'T I TELL YOU NEVER TO COME PANHANDLING AROUND HERE
DO I LOOK AS FUNNY AS YOU DO
DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET HIDING PLACE HERE IN THE HOUSE
DO YOU MIND IF WE GO SOMEPLACE CROWDED
DO YOU SEE THIS
DO YOU WANT TO WAKE THAT BABY
DOES A MAN'S HEART ALWAYS HELP HIM THE BOY ASKED THE ALCHEMIST
DOES THIS BELONG TO YOU
DOESNT IT DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF HASHING
DON'T ARGUE WITH ME HERE
DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE
DON'T LET THEM SEE THAT YOU'RE AFRAID THE ALCHEMIST SAID
DON'T MIND THE COLONEL
DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES
DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT GIRL'S VERY SICK
DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON
DONT FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE IT WOULD NOT HELP
DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AT AN ABANDONED CHURCH
EARLIER THIS YEAR WE FOUND A REALLY NICE PLACE NEAR MY OFFICE AND WE MOVED IN TOGETHER
EGYPT IS A COUNTRY THAT IS OFTEN MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE
EVEN IF YOU CLEANED MY CRYSTAL FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR
EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE EVOLVED HE SAID
EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM
FASTFOOD IS CONVENIENT BUT OFTEN UNHEALTHY
FEBRUARY TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES
FILL THIS PLACE WITH A SANDSTORM SO STRONG THAT IT BLOTS OUT THE SUN
FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
FOR USERS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY CAN TRUST THEIR OPERATING SYSTEM
FROM THAT DAY ON IT WAS THE DESERT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT
FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
GET DOWN QUICK
GET ME WALTER BURNS
GET SOME WATER QUICKLY
GET THE BULLETIN BOARD
GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SEASON
GOOD LUCK TO YOU
HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
HARRY'LL TEAR HIS DINNER SUIT
HAS HE BEEN HERE
HAVE A GOOD TRIP
HAVE YOU GOT A MIRROR
HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
HE AROSE AND TAKING UP HIS CROOK BEGAN TO AWAKEN THE SHEEP THAT STILL SLEPT
HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
HE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE PRACTICAL MATTERS
HE DECIDED TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE
HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
HE DIDN'T NEED TO DEMONSTRATE HIS SCIENCE AND ART TO ANYONE
HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT
HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
HE HAD ASSUMED HE WOULD SOON RETURN TO HIS SHEEP
HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
HE HAD BEEN TO THE VILLAGE ONLY ONCE THE YEAR BEFORE
HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED
HE HAD NO IDEA HOW HE WAS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND
HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
HE HAD STUDIED LATIN SPANISH AND THEOLOGY
HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
HE IS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND JUST TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWERS
HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE CUSTOMS OF THE STRANGE LAND HE WAS IN
HE KNEW WHAT I WAS THINKING THE BOY SAID TO HIMSELF
HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
HE NEVER ASKED ME TO SIT DOWN IN HIS LIFE
HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
HE PAID FOR THE WOOL AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR
HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS WERE
HE RECITED AN OUR FATHER SILENTLY
HE REMEMBERED THE SWORD
HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
HE SAT ON A STONE AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED BY THE HORIZON
HE STILL CALLS HIS MOTHER MUMMY
HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
HE THOUGHT OF ALL THE MARRIED SHEPHERDS HE HAD KNOWN
HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE MORNING'S MEETING
HE WANTED YOUR MONEY HE SAID
HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY
HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
HE WAS MY BROTHER
HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF
HE WAS THINKING ABOUT OMENS AND SOMEONE HAD APPEARED
HE WASHED THE DETRITUS FROM HIS HAIR
HE'S ALLERGIC TO HIM
HE'S DEPOSITED TEN DOLLARS
HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
HE'S IN MY ROOM
HE'S NUTS ABOUT YOU
HE'S THE MAN THE ADS ARE WRITTEN FOR
HE'S THE ONLY HUSBAND I'VE GOT
HELP MY FRIEND MR RICHARD
HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
HER ACHIEVEMENTS WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HOLE
HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
HIS NAME IS WELCH
HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
HOW ABOUT ONCE MORE AROUND THE PARK
HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE
HOW ARE YOU
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
HOW COULD HE BE A FAKE
HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
HOW DO I GUESS AT THE FUTURE
HOW DO YOU HANDLE THE NEGATIVE WEIGHTS
HOW DO YOU MEAN
HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU GET
HOW WAS THAT FOR A TIGHT SQUEEZE
HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
I AM HERE THE BOY SAID
I BET YOU FORGOT THE WINE
I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
I CAN EXPLAIN IF YOU'LL JUST LISTEN
I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE
I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY
I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
I DIDN'T COME HERE TO HAVE YOU READ MY PALM HE SAID ALREADY REGRETTING HAVING COME
I DIDN'T FALL IN
I DIDN'T FRISK HIM
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET SOME STYLISH UNDERWEAR
I DO WANT THAT PLATINUM RING
I DON'T BELIEVE IT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRANSMITTED BY WORD OF MOUTH HE THOUGHT
I DON'T KNOW YOU FROM ADAM
I DON'T LIKE SEALS ANYHOW
I DON'T MUCH LIKE CHANGE HE SAID
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CHANGE
I FEEL LIKE A BOOTLEGGER
I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
I GOT IT BACK
I GOTTA FIGURE SOME WAY OUT OF THIS THING
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP
I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT MY HORIZON HAS EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY
I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE HIM SINCE
I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
I JUMPED IN TO SAVE RACHEL
I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
I KNOW ITS DIMENSIONS AND HOW IT BEHAVES
I KNOW THAT GIRL
I LEFT HER HANGING AROUND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS
I LOST MY WALLET
I MAKE MY LIVING FORECASTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE HE SAID
I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL THE BOY TOLD THE MERCHANT
I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
I NEVER SAW AMANDA ACT LIKE THAT BEFORE
I NEVER STOLE A WATCH IN MY LIFE
I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED
I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
I REALLY DID IT QUITE BRILLIANTLY
I SAID I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN
I THINK IT'S ABOUT BIRD HUNTING BUT NOW I CAN SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED
I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
I THOUGHT YOU WERE CHASING ME
I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
I WANT THOSE STAMPS
I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS
I WANT TO STAY AT THE OASIS THE BOY ANSWERED
I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY ANSWERED
I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
I WAS JUST ASKING
I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
I WILL BE BACK SOON
I WISH THEY WERE TOO
I WISH YOU WOULDN'T
I WISH YOU'D FORGET ABOUT US
I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
I WOULDN'T WANT TO USE THAT TUB
I'D BETTER HUSTLE HIM UP
I'D HATE TO HAVE THAT MANY PINS STUCK IN ME
I'M AFRAID I MIGHT HAVE SOILED THE COUCH A LITTLE WITH MY SHOES EDDIE MURPHY
I'M AFRAID SHE'D FEEL ASHAMED TO THINK SHE HADN'T TRUSTED YOU
I'M AFRAID THE JOKE'S ON US
I'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
I'M AN ALCHEMIST SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M AN ALCHEMIST HE SAID AS HE PREPARED THE MEAL
I'M EVERYTHING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID I WAS
I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME
I'M GOING TO CHECK UP ON THAT RIGHT AWAY
I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
I'M GOING TO GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE DESERT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
I'M GOING TO NEED IT
I'M GOING TO THEM
I'M GONNA BUILD AIR FIELDS
I'M IN A DRUGSTORE
I'M LEAVING TODAY SAID THE BOY
I'M LOVING IT
I'M NOT AFRAID OF FAILING
I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
I'M SMOKING TOO MUCH
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING AND LOAN
I'M THE KING OF SALEM THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THIS
I'VE WATCHED YOU GROW UP FROM A LITTLE BOY
IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW
IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER
IF HE ABANDONS THAT PURSUIT IT'S BECAUSE IT WASN'T TRUELOVE
IF HE EVER DECIDED TO LEAVE THEM THEY WOULD SUFFER
IF I'M ON THE MARCH I JUST CONCENTRATE ON MARCHING
IF IT WOULD SAVE A WOMAN'S LIFE
IF WHAT ONE FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTER IT WILL NEVER SPOIL
IF YOU DON'T STOP FOLLOWING ME I'LL CALL THE POLICE
IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE WAR IS OVER THEN WAIT
IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
IN HIS HEART HE WANTED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO SLEEP
IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
IN THE DISCOTHEQUE THE DJ PLAYED PROGRESSIVE HOUSE MUSIC AND TRANCE
IS SHE AS GOOD AS YOU SAY
IS THE HEAD BETTER
IS THERE A MRS JOSHUA
IT ALL HAPPENED RATHER SUDDENLY
IT ALWAYS HELPS TO BE LEARNING SOMETHING NEW AND EXCITING
IT BELONGS TO ME NOW
IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
IT COMMENCED TO BLOW HARDER RAISING THE DESERT SANDS
IT CONSIDERS THE HORIZONTAL DIMENSION AS TIME
IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
IT HAD TOLD HIM TO DIG WHERE HIS TEARS FELL
IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE
IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
IT IS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
IT REQUIRED NO EXPLANATION JUST AS THE UNIVERSE NEEDS NONE AS IT TRAVELS THROUGH ENDLESS TIME
IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE THE LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING
IT SORT OF MAKES A FELLOW LOSE FAITH IN HIMSELF
IT WAS A A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY
IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELED BY FIREWOOD WITH A TRANSPARENT FLASK HEATING ON TOP
IT WAS A TENT LIKE MANY AT THE OASIS
IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
IT WAS ENGINEERING AT ITS FINEST
IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
IT WAS HARASSMENT PURE AND SIMPLE
IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
IT WAS IMMEDIATELY APPARENT
IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
IT WAS PAPA THAT SENDS YOU FLOWERS EVERY DAY
IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WINE HE HAD EVER TASTED
IT WAS THE PURE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
IT WON'T HURT YOU AND WE CAN MAKE THE CITY EDITION
IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
IT'S COMMON TO RUN INTO PROBLEMS SO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY
IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
IT'S LATE IN THE EVENING A PERFECT TIME FOR COFFEE
IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
IT'S NOT A LIE
IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT IT MATTERS A LOT
IT'S THE NAME OF THE PROPHET'S DAUGHTER FATIMA SAID
IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
IT'S THE ONLY NAME I'VE GOT
IT'S THE ONLY ONE THEY HAD LEFT
IT'S THE OTHER FOREIGNER THE ENGLISHMAN
IT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT GUARANTEES EVERYONE'S FREEDOM
JENNIFER'S EXPRESSION CHANGED PULL MY FINGER SHE SAID
JOHNATHAN ASSESSED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY
JUST A MEMORY RIGHT NOW IT SIGNIFIED SHADE WATER AND A REFUGE FROM THE WAR
JUST AS A RULE OF THUMB
JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
JUST THE ANT COLONY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
KEEP HIM IN HERE
LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
LET HIM HAVE EVERYTHING HE WANTS
LICORICE IS A BLACK CHEWY FOOD
LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOURLEAF CLOVERS
LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
LOOK AT THOSE SHOULDERS
LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
LOOKS LIKE ABOUT TEN YEARS A PIECE FOR YOU BIRDS
LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
MAKTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY ALWAYS STAY CLOSE TO ME
MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY GIVE UP ON IT SO EARLY TOO
MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
MAYBE TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER THAN YESTERDAY
MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
MECCA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS
MEN HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS OF THE WISE
MIND IF I SIT DOWN
MOHAMMED IS A WONDERFUL GUITAR PLAYER
MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
MR BEAN IS THE MAIN CHARACTER OF A BRITISH COMEDY
MR BRAD CABLES YOU NEED CASH
MRS SARAH DOESN'T EITHER
MY ALLERGY HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE TODAY
MY FATHER OFFERED HER A JOB
MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY
MY KEYCHAIN IS HEAVY AND AWKWARD TO CARRY IN MY POCKET
MY MIND RAN ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS CONTENT
MY NAME'S PETE DAVIS
MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT
NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELERS
NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECKPOINTS
NOBODY'S TRYING TO STEAL FROM YOU
NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
NOT TO WORRY SAID THE ALCHEMIST
NOTE THAT IT DOES HAVE BUILTIN SUPPORT FOR WEB BROWSING ALTHOUGH I FIND IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL
NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FELLOWS A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
ONE AFTERNOON ONE OF HIS SERVANTS FELL ILL AND IT APPEARED THAT HE WOULD DIE
ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
ONE DAY THE EARTH BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE NILE OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
ONE MUST PREPARE FOR IT
ONLY US EXPLORERS CAN GET IT
OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT
PATRICK HAS TERMINAL CANCER
PEOPLE CONTINUED TO COME AND GO FROM THE BAKER'S SHOP
PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS VILLAGE SON SAID HIS FATHER
PERHAPS SHE MET SOMEBODY
PHONE THE NEWSPAPERS
PRETTY NICE NECK YOU'VE GOT THERE
PUT JACKIE RIGHT ON THE STAFF
RAISINS ARE DELICIOUS
RELAXED AND UNHURRIED HE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD WALK THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF TANGIER
REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOUR HEART IS THERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR TREASURE
REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
SAME WAY YOU DID
SAVE THAT FOR THE TRIBUNE
SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
SEPARATION OF GARBAGE MAKES RECYCLING POSSIBLE
SERVANTS CAME AND WENT WITH SILVER TRAYS LADEN WITH SPICES AND TEA
SHALL I PUT A LITTLE RUM IN THE COFFEE
SHE JOINED UP TOO
SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALEX PRETTY WELL
SHE NEVER GREW UP
SHE WENT OVER TO THE HOSPITAL TO CALL ON PROFESSOR DAVIS
SHE WROTE THE STUFF
SHOW ME WHERE THERE IS LIFE OUT IN THE DESERT
SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
SO IMMERSE YOURSELF IN IT
SO NOW I FEAR NOTHING BECAUSE IT WAS THOSE OMENS THAT BROUGHT YOU TO ME
SO THE BOY WAS DISAPPOINTED HE DECIDED THAT HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN BELIEVE IN DREAMS
SO THEN TRY HE SAID TO THE ENGLISHMAN
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME THE SUN ASKED
SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON
SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
SORT OF A JACK LONDON STYLE
STOVE'S HOTTER THAN I THOUGHT
STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS
SUNBURNS CAN BE AVOIDED BY APPLYING SUNSCREEN OR BY STAYING IN THE SHADOWS
SURE I KNOW WHERE SHE LIVES
SURE SEE YOU THERE
SYMBOLS OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE
TAKE CHARGE OF HIM
TAKE YOUR PAWS OFF ME
THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
THAT HE HAD ATTENDED A SEMINARY UNTIL HE WAS SIXTEEN
THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
THAT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
THAT NIGHT HE TOLD ALL OF THIS TO THE ALCHEMIST
THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
THAT WAS HIS WORK
THAT WASN'T AT ALL NECESSARY
THAT WOMAN IS GONNA BE ON THAT ROOF
THAT'S AN INHERENT DISADVANTAGE
THAT'S COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES
THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
THAT'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID
THAT'S WHAT ALCHEMISTS DO
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ROMANTIC
THAT'S WHY ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE NICE
THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
THE ACHIEVED RESULTS ARE FAR BEHIND THE STATEOFTHEART IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
THE ALARM CLOCK WAS SET FOR TWENTY PAST THREE
THE ALCHEMIST ERASED THE CIRCLE IN THE SAND AND THE SNAKE SLITHERED AWAY AMONG THE ROCKS
THE ALCHEMIST FOLLOWED AS THE BOY'S HORSE RAN FOR ALMOST HALF AN HOUR
THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO COOL
THE ARROW WAS POINTING TO THE EXIT
THE BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS A SURPRISE
THE BOOK THAT MOST INTERESTED THE BOY TOLD THE STORIES OF THE FAMOUS ALCHEMISTS
THE BOSS SENT ME OVER WITH IT
THE BOY APPROACHED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHEMIST
THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN
THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
THE BOY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
THE BOY FELT ILL AND TERRIBLY ALONE
THE BOY HAD MET THE ALCHEMIST
THE BOY KNEW AND WAS NOW WORKING TOWARD IT
THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION
THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
THE BOY PRODDED THEM ONE BY ONE WITH HIS CROOK CALLING EACH BY NAME
THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
THE BOY RECALLED THE BRILLIANCE HE HAD NOTICED ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
THE BOY REMEMBERED HIS DREAM AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR TO HIM
THE BOY REPEATED HIS QUESTION
THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
THE BOY SWORE THAT EVERY TIME HE HEARD THE ALARM HE WOULD HEED ITS MESSAGE
THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
THE BOY WAS SAD AS HE LEFT HER THAT DAY
THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
THE BOY WENT TO THE WELL EVERY DAY TO MEET WITH FATIMA
THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
THE CHARCOAL BURNED AWAY TO WHITE ASH
THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON
THE DISPLAY WAS UNDERWHELMING
THE DUNES ARE CHANGED BY THE WIND BUT THE DESERT NEVER CHANGES
THE ELEVATORS ARE STILL RUNNING
THE ENGLISHMAN HAD SEVERAL SUITCASES FILLED WITH BOOKS
THE FIRE ALARM WENT OFF AGAIN BUT WHEN I LOOKED OUTSIDE THERE WAS NO ONE THERE
THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
THE FLOCK OF FLAMINGOS LANDED GRACEFULLY ON THEIR AWKWARD LOOKING LEGS
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
THE FOOTBALL JOCKS LAUGHED VICIOUSLY
THE FOREST BURNED FOR THIRTEEN DAYS
THE FUMES FROM THE TRAFFIC WAS UNBEARABLE
THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED
THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
THE HEAT LASTED UNTIL NIGHTFALL AND ALL THAT TIME HE HAD TO CARRY HIS JACKET
THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
THE HOOKAHS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUARDS STOOD AT ATTENTION
THE IDEAS SHOULD BE PRESENTED IN A MORE CONCISE AND DIRECT MANNER
THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SO DID THE BOY
THE LEVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
THE LIBRARY IS OPEN TO EVERYONE
THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
THE MAN LOOKED AT THE ANGEL IN SURPRISE
THE MAN WEPT WITH HAPPINESS
THE MEETING WAS OVER
THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION
THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
THE MONK WAS IRRITATED
THE NAVY'S GOING TO FLY FATHER HOME THIS AFTERNOON
THE NEARBY CITY OF CEUTA HAD GROWN FASTER THAN TANGIER AND BUSINESS HAD FALLEN OFF
THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
THE OASIS IS NEUTRAL GROUND
THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
THE OLD MAN LEAFED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
THE OLD MAN OPENED HIS CAPE AND THE BOY WAS STRUCK BY WHAT HE SAW
THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
THE OTHER SON WAS A POET AND DELIGHTED ALL OF ROME WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL VERSES
THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
THE PILOTS BRACED THEMSELVES FOR IMPACT
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
THE RESTAURANT WAS QUITE EXPENSIVE
THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
THE SHEEP FIDGETED NEARBY UNEASY WITH THEIR NEW OWNER AND EXCITED BY SO MUCH CHANGE
THE SHEPHERD SWORE THAT HE WOULD
THE SHIP APPEARED TO BE CONSTRUCTED WITH SOME FORM OF CHROMIUM EXOSKELETON
THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
THE SHOP WAS BUSY AND THE MAN ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON
THE SNOW BLASTED ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
THE SPACE WAS SPARTAN ALMOST BARE
THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
THE STRANGER WITHDREW THE SWORD FROM THE BOY'S FOREHEAD AND THE BOY FELT IMMENSELY RELIEVED
THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
THE SUN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE
THE SUN WAS TURNED INTO A GOLDEN DISK
THE TEA SEEMED LESS BITTER
THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
THE TRADITION TEACHES MEN HOW TO CROSS THE DESERT AND HOW THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD MARRY
THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
THE TWO WALKED OUT AMONG THE PALMS
THE VIRUS SPREAD FASTER THAN WILDFIRE
THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN
THE WIRELESS JOYPAD WAS EXPERIENCING CONNECTION ISSUES
THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
THE YEARS OF RESEARCH THE MAGIC SYMBOLS THE STRANGE WORDS AND THE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT
THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
THEN A MAN APPROACHED
THEN GET OUT OF HERE
THEN HE TURNED TO THE BOY
THEN LEAVE WITH THE CARAVAN
THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MORE TEA
THEN THEY GOT AHOLD OF SOME DOUGH AND WENT GOOFY
THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT SORTS OF FUEL AT THIS GAS STATION
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO LEARN
THERE IS A REPTILE IN MY WESTERN SHOES
THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
THERE ISN'T ANY MORE WINE
THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE
THERE WAS A HOLE THERE AMONG THE STONES
THERE WAS A LOUD SHRIEK FROM A WOMAN STANDING BEHIND US
THERE WAS A SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE STATUE
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COMPANY
THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
THERE WAS NO OTHER BAGGAGE
THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD HIM BACK EXCEPT HIMSELF
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
THERE'S A LOT MORE YOU CAN DO WITH A TIGHTER INTEGRATION WITH THE EYE TRACKING API
THERE'S A MOON OUT TONIGHT
THERE'S LIFE HERE THE BOY SAID TO THE ALCHEMIST
THERE'S THAT REPRIEVE IF THEY EVER FIND OUT
THERESA COULDN'T FEEL ANY MORE DUMB RIGHT NOW
THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
THEY ERASED ALL EVIDENCE OF THEIR CRIMES
THEY FILLED THREE SACKS
THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOSED OFF THE CONVERSATION
THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE
THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
THEY WANTED TO SAVE THE OASIS
THEY WENT TO THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE MONASTERY
THEY WERE ALL FURIOUS WHEN THE ESCAPADE FAILED
THEY WERE ALWAYS JUST SOMEBODY TO FILL UP THE BLEACHERS
THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT HIS DESTINY TO THE END
THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS A PRESENT BY A KING THE BOY SAID
THEY WERE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT AND CLAMORED TO HEAR HIS STORIES ABOUT THE GREAT CITIES
THEY WERE RACING DOWN THE STREETS WITH NO REGARD FOR ANYONE
THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
THEY WERE TRIBESMEN DRESSED IN BLUE WITH BLACK RINGS SURROUNDING THEIR TURBANS
THEY'RE CALLING TO US NOT TO GIVE UP AND TO KEEP ON FIGHTING
THEY'RE NOT FOR SALE HE SAID
THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
THIRTY EVERY THURSDAY SIXTY AT SIXTY WHO KNOWS WHAT
THIS BEHAVIOR OF NEURAL NETWORKS IS SOMETIMES CALLED DREAMING
THIS DESERT WAS ONCE A SEA HE SAID
THIS GUY STOLE MY WATCH
THIS IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION SHELDON SAID
THIS IS A TRICK TO GET YOUR SYMPATHY
THIS IS FOR YOU
THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
THIS IS JON DAVIS
THIS IS THE MORNING POST YOU'RE TALKING TO
THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
THIS SOLUTION ALSO WORKS WELL IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL A LINUX DISTRO ON WINDOWS VIA VIRTUALIZATION
THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
THIS WILL HELP YOU EFFECTIVELY COLLABORATE WITH DEVELOPERS AND COORDINATE CROSSTEAM PROJECTS THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER
THOSE GYPSIES ARE REALLY SMART HE THOUGHT
THREE DAYS FROM NOW HE WOULD BE WITH THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
TO CALIBRATE THE MOTION CAPTURING SYSTEM PLEASE DO A TPOSE
TO NOURISH THE FALCON
TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
TONIGHT THEY WOULD FIND OUT THE TRUTH
TRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU'RE IN THE DESERT
TWO DAYS AGO YOU SAID THAT I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TRAVEL THE MERCHANT ANSWERED
TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
TWO HORSEMEN WAITING AHEAD OF THEM
TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT I HAD A RECURRENT DREAM TOO
UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
VICTORIA DOES THINGS IN A MUCH BIGGER WAY
WAIT FOR THE END OF THE WAR
WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS
WANT TO WALK TO NEW YORK
WATCH OVER HER TONIGHT
WE ATE SPICY RICE WITH CHICKEN LEGS AND WHITE MUSHROOMS
WE CAN ONLY PERCEIVE A PART OF THE BROAD LIGHT SPECTRUM THE SUN EMITS
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
WE MUST BE GOOD
WE WANT SOME ACTION IN THESE PICTURES
WE'LL PAY ALL YOUR EXPENSES
WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PLODDING THROUGH SOME USER INTERVIEWS AT THE MOMENT
WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
WEAR THE BLUE ONE
WELL THEN HELP ME DO THAT THE BOY SAID
WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
WELL WHAT GOOD WOULD IT BE TO YOU IF YOU HAD T DIE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO TO MECCA NOW ASKED THE BOY
WELLI DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WERE THEY QUICK OR WERE THEY ENRAGED
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WHAT GOOD IS MONEY TO YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIE
WHAT HE SAID REMINDED THE BOY OF THE OLD KING
WHAT IF YOU CAN'T STAND HIM
WHAT IS A FOREIGNER DOING HERE ASKED ANOTHER OF THE MEN
WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED
WHAT TRICKS WOULD I PULL
WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO WRITE ABOUT HILLARY
WHAT WERE YOU WHEN YOU CAME HERE FIVE YEARS AGO
WHAT YOUR HUSBAND WAS MIXED UP IN
WHAT'S IN THAT DESK
WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
WHEN HE EMERGED IT WAS WITH A YOUNG ARAB DRESSED IN WHITE AND GOLD
WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID
WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
WHEN THE SIMUM CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEEN
WHERE ARE YOU BOUND ASKED THE YOUNG ARAB
WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
WHO IS THIS STRANGER WHO SPEAKS OF OMENS ASKED ONE OF THE CHIEFTAINS EYEING THE BOY
WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED
WHO TOLD YOU THAT ASKED THE BOY STARTLED
WHO WROTE THAT SPEECH FOR YOU
WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED
WHY DO YOU WANT TO FIND THAT SORT OF PERSON THE ARAB ASKED
WILL I LEARN TO DO THAT SOMEDAY THE BOY ASKED
WILL YOU EXCUSE US A MINUTE
WILL YOU GIVE ME THOSE STAMPS
WISH I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS
WITH THE GIRL WITH THE RAVEN HAIR HIS DAYS WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
YOU ALL KNOW ME
YOU BROUGHT A NEW FEELING INTO MY CRYSTAL SHOP
YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER
YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST ABOUT BEING DISHONEST
YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN ANYTHING
YOU DONT COMPARE DIRECTLY TO EXISTING STATEOFTHEART METHODS
YOU HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR DREAMS ABOUT THE OLD KING AND YOUR TREASURE
YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
YOU MEAN HERE IN THE CITY
YOU MUST NOT LET UP EVEN AFTER HAVING COME SO FAR HE CONTINUED
YOU MUSTN'T LET WHAT SHE SAID BOTHER YOU
YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
YOU SAID YOU WANTED FIREWORKS
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
YOU THINK IT'S EASY
YOU TOLD ME THAT
YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
YOU WILL NEVER REOPEN
YOU WILL SPEND THAT HOUR GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH MARSHALL BAILEY
YOU'LL NEVER GET IT OUT OF ME
YOU'RE A WEEK LATE FOR SCHOOL ALREADY
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WITCH DOCTORS HE SPOKE SOME VERSES FROM THE KORAN AND MOVED ON
YOU'RE STILL A GOOD REPORTER
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAY DIE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
YOU'RE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD
YOU'VE GOT HIS GUN
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN BORN
YOUR HEART IS ALIVE
